    "Question": "first i would like to say hello to everyone and thanks for all the knowledge on the stie. i have been a long time reader but not a poster. after getting home in 2006 from oif, i tried to go back to life as usual. but my idea of life as usual had changed, while deployed i lost/broke off contact with most friends and family. i tried going back to college, but being around all those people that had no clue what was really going on in the world wa getting to me. i stopped going to classes, having to sit around and listen to try to recite stories they heard from friends, or friends of friends, or saw on tv about the war bothers me to no end. sorry, getting a little side tracked. 2007 dx with ptsd, awarded 70%. after having a situation at work, i was unemployed again. i was told i should look into filing for an increase and maybe even ssdi. did some research mostly with the help of this site, got all my paperwork in order and filed. it took about 3 months to get the ssdi. then 2 months after that 100% for ptsd, 50% sa. being that i'm 27 now, i keep wondering how long i have to get my shit together, start interacting, and be productive again. i stress over when/if they are just going to stop sending the checks. can that happen? how do the drs determine if you are getting better or worse for that matter? what is normal these days?",
    "Response_1": "You didn't say if your 100% is P&T. If it is that changes things a little. Being 27 you have your whole life in front of you . Us old VN vets didn't have anyone to help us after our war but you guys do. \n\nI think I would have had alot better chance at overcoming my PTSD if I got help 30 years ago which is where you are at. \n\nDon't be discouraged by 1 little job ,I had over 40 in my life before I went to the VA and get some help. \n\nAs far as stress over the check ,you will always be looking over your shoulder waiting for uncle sam to take it away. That's the part that sucks.",
    "Response_2": "Look, Bro. Until they come up with some magic pill or something THERE IS NO CURE FOR PTSD. Like Peoplesniffer I'm a Nam vet and I have Chronic delayed PTSD. I think Combat related PTSD is pretty much all the same just different degrees of harshness. If you continue to seek help( Therapy, Meds etc) ,you will learn coping skills and avoid the things that trigger you. The VA will not just cut your comp off. But I know the feeling. I just wish to hell we had some treatment options when we came home. All you can do is the best YOU can and move on. Best of luck.",
    "Response_3": "i'm not p&t yet... i wasnt sure if that was something that i wanted to apply for just yet. it would be nice to have my wife and child covered medically. but as it is right now i have to drive a hour to get to the va, cursing and wanting to run people off the road the whole way. i go to my dr for our monthly \"how are you session.\" he makes sure i'm on pills and sends me on my way. i have been on the meds and all the do is make me compliant. while on the meds seems like free will is gone and i'm just there. the money is nice to have but i miss having a life. i'm sick of people jokingly tellin me to get a job. i had a job, i was a senior in college, i had plans... now i stay home aone most of the time barely interacting with my wife and child, a bunch of meds to make me happy, sleepy, take away pain, and who knows what else. so i'm still wondering whats next.... or is this what i have to look forward to?",
    "Response_4": "I wasnt that whole lot much older than you when I was diagnosed with this. Ive been up this way now 12 years - It was hard and still is to say I am medically retired to other people. I dont say anything. But alot of people ask me what I do. Just in casual conversation. I feel like and felt like saying- none of your damn buisness. I cant work- I dont work- and if you tell them anything I am screwed. So I dont say anything. I have had a load of loner self cause of my age. Especially before Iraq hit- Because Im an inbetween vet on IU pt and sc 100percent and - it hasnt been easy- How come I dont work. Doesnt matter to me any more those questions is nobodys buisness. Unfortuantly it is what it is and its the way it is and my life is with my dog and kitty now. I fought myself for a long time trying to undo being laid up like this. It didnt change anything except the fact alot of wasted energy- \nI finally went out and went fishing. Caught some sturgeon- picked up some hobbies- and also made myself useful volunteering at some national parks. The words still came about- What do I do for a living. \nNone of your damn buisness- Im a retired veteran- PERIOD. End of story- Medically retired for good- good bye - we paid our dues and You dont have to explain yourself to no one. Ever- \nwelcome to this board and be a proud Vet. I am.",
    "Response_5": "I was just rated 70% for PTSD. I know how you feel. I have been arrested 2 times, hate being around people unless they are VETS, Tried the college thing but the kids their are so spoiled and irritating that I was having visions of beating their asses. When I was contemplating really taking a cell phone from this kid in my class and smashing it in front of the whole class because he kept texting I decided that I had better just stay away from the college atmosphere for a while or I would get arrested again. BTW did I mention it was an Ethics class LOL. I have been going to counciling at VA and am trying to at least get over my knee jerk reactions with idiots. I am currently seeking help from Vocab Rehab to maybe help me get a better type of work. Right now I am working as a mechanic and I hate it, I feel like I am in the Army again doing my old job, but it pays the bills. Anyways I was going to suggest if you are trying to get better, well lets say, manage your PTSD better try the counciling at VA. I go once a week and I tell ya, it is free, and you can talk about whats bugging you. It helps me, it might not help you but IMO I think it is worth a try.. Take care and remember you arent alone.."

    "Question": "It has been a few months since I last commented. I literary had to switch CBOCS and Vet Centers, due to a high turnover in staff. My question is.....will the bipolar disorder be A. Overridden, B. Changed, or C. Combined with the PTSD? Bottom line is I want the correct diagnosis. What is wrong with asking for that? I could care less about the percentages. I am fed up with taking meds that only do the opposite of what their intended use is for. I went from taking FOURTEEN meds a day, to Only 2 meds a day. I am now feeling more stable, happier, and no longer doing things that get me in trouble. Example: Continuing an argument LONG AFTER I could have walked away. Whenever law enforcement was involved, I was more defiant. I would get maced, and just laugh at them........until the stunner came out. I have more charges of disturbing the peace than there are people residing at the bottom of the sea. I went out and got myself 2 dogs. They are life savers. When they get up in my grill, I know they know I am stressed, and I calm myself down. IF they both go upstairs for hours on end, I know they know I am in a bad mood, and I then perform \"distraction therapy\".......I go fishing.",
    "Response_1": "Having stressors does not automatically mean that you have PTSD. If it did, about 99.9% of ALL veterans would have PTSD.\n\nYou could have Bi-Polar Disorder by itself; PTSD by itself, or a combination of B-Polar Disorder and PTSD (or any other mental disorder that you might have).\n\nIt is not at all uncommon for a person to have 2 or more disorders. If you do, the VA would use whichever is the most predominant as your \"label\", but would also factor in the effects of BOTH, in determining your level of disability.",
    "Response_2": "I am still going through this \"transformation\" process. Instead of being prescribed to a multiples of meds, I am now on only one. It is not for Bipolar, yet instead, PTSD. My problem list now only says PTSD. I have also observed that my quality of life has improved dramatically, since the meds were switched. The meds were doing the reverse of what they were prescribed, hence, a total of 162 different meds (mostly anti-psychotics, anti-depressants, from Buspar to Zyprexa). At first, I was angry and bitter about what was going on. I decided there is nothing I can do about yesterday. I am only in control of tomorrow. I have a rather LENGTHY C&P Exam (multiple contenions, due to permanent damage, resulting from side-effects, of various meds), coming up. I will keep you posted.",
    "Response_3": "My rating is \"PTSD with Bipolar Disorder\"  Indeed I am both, and VA got it right.  Turn in evidence of all mental health conditions I say.  \n\nWhen asked at my C&P exam by the doc, which one I thought was more relevant to me I told him I thought that was something he should sort out because I really had no clue.",
    "Response_4": "You are only going to be rated on one mental disability.  If you think you are entitled to a higher rating for your mental related symptoms, review the rating criteria for the next, higher percentage  and if you qualify (first thread in this section contains the criteria for mental disorders), then file a new claim.  Good luck with your decision going forward.",

    "Question": "Last year I filed for an increase due to issues with employment. I am a high school teacher, and I was having some anger issues in the classroom that forced me to rethink my choice of employment. I went in for the exam with a contracted agency (VES), and it lasted about 15-20 minutes. The guy asked me a few questions and I explained to him the problems I was having. When my paperwork comes back I have been recommended for a 20% decrease. Due to some fumbling by my VSO, I didn't get to request a hearing. They didn't know which route to take, and then sent the request in, only to have the VA tell me it was \"too early\" to request the hearing in a letter I got AFTER my rating was reduced. It's all said and done now, and I have decided not to file again. My question is: what WOULD HAVE been the correct route to take? They couldn't seem to decide whether I needed to request a hearing or file my NOD since it was an existing condition. By the way, I changed organizations. Also, I saw a civilian doc and he got me a prescription that has helped alot in my job.",
    "Response_1": "That is one of the dangers when you file for an increase, but do NOT have any ongoing treatment records. You are at the mercy of an examiner.\n\nThe VA sends out notices to your address of record. It is VERY important to make certain that BOTH the VA Regional Office (they handle claims) and your VA Medical Center or Clinic have your correct address. They do NOT share that information, so you need to notify BOTH of them, preferably in writing.\n\nThe VA ALWAYS sends a proposal to reduce a rating to the veteran involved. That is when you request a hearing, to present evidence that you do NOT warrant a reduction. But, since you were not being seen by anyone, you would not have had any evidence to present.\n\nThis was NOT your VSO's fault, it was YOURS. YOU are responsible for your own claims, and it is up to YOU to make certain that everything gets sent in, etc., etc. VSO's can be a great help, but ultimately the responsibility is actually ours.",
    "Response_2": "I caution every vet who comes into the VARO and wants to file for an increase, especially if they have a fairly high rating on what they want to claim again\n\nFirst, it's not \"an increase\" it's a re-evaluation. Rating do get reduced, you better be rock solid in your request for a re-eval. Reductions happen more often in these cases than the average vet thinks. \n\nSecond, see the first. \n\nAs far as paths. 30 days after the notification letter to request a hearing. 60 days after notification to challenge the reduction. 1 year to request reconsideration, 1 year to file NOD.",
    "Response_3": "A VSO at the VA filed for IU for me and I had a PTSD C&P.  After that they raise my PTSD up to 100% T&P now.\nBut, I am very severe bad, plus have TBI.",

    "Question": "Good morning all. First and foremost, I am currently rated 80% (70-ptsd, 10-tinnitus, 10-scars). I was awarded my current percentages early 2014. I have battled with ptsd and behavioral health issues since discharging from the military. Here is a quick synopsis before asking my questions. Before getting my current award, I have used my GI Bill and Post 9/11. Due to ongoing treatment and problems at work (triggers and such), I applied for Voc Rehab to try to get school to change careers. Basically went into the office and laid out my case. The counselor, in a nut-shell, told me that because I am currently employed and not in \"trouble\" or been written up at work, she had no choice but to deny my claim. I left in tears after explaining to her that it is literally torture to walk into work due to the environment that I work in being almost identical to the one that caused my ptsd in the military. After more than 10 years of behavioral health treatment through the VA, my condition(s) are continually getting worse. I am to the point where I am wanting to request an increase to 100% to be able to survive financially and pursue as much treatment as I can. After the frustrating Voc Rehab appointment, Monday I sent a Privacy Act request to the VBA office to request a copy of my Voc Rehab evaluation by the counselor. I want to make sure before I file for an increase, that all my ducks are in a row and she didn't type or word anything to hurt my case. I have a couple more pysch appts next week. I guess my questions are:\n\n1)How do I go about filing a FDC for increase for PTSD?\n2)Do I need to include any treatment records since they are all through the VA\n3) Depending on the Voc Rehab report, should I include that as well?\n4) How long do FDC for increase for one issue normally take?\n\nAfter thorough reading of all the PTSD posts, which in fact helped relieve my anxiety on my first PTSD claim, I know that by opening it up for increase, my current rating will be on the line. I honestly don't see with my continued dibilitating symptoms that it could ever go below my current rating. Thank you all for advice and insight!",
    "Response_1": "First of all, if you are in a field that you don't believe that you should be, then change jobs! With 80% S/C, you should be able to work even a minimum wage job, and still get by.\n\nWork can't be all that bad, if you are not being written up, not having problems getting your work done, etc., etc. While this may be a huge problem for YOU, this is something that you SHOULD be addressing in treatment. Treatment is NOT designed to give you reasons to run away from your problems. If your treating people are not addressing this, after you bring it up, then change therapists, etc. If you are not working on this with them, then it simply can't be all that bad, or you are NOT addressing the real problems.\n\nTREATMENT SHOULD ALWAYS BE YOUR NUMBER 1 GOAL! \n\nIn order to get increased to 100% S/C, you are going to need treatment records that demonstrate that you simply can not perform any work on a regular basis. Not that you don't want to be there, but that you are unable to perform anything other than minimal employment. So, either way, treatment should be what you atre seeking.",
    "Response_2": "Three separate issues:\n\n1. Your disability: an increase in your PTSD rating requires total occupational and social impairment...and IU definitely requires that your disability makes you unable to work. But you're saying you could work other jobs but are stymied by the GS system...there seems to be a contradiction here. \n\n2. Your financial needs: as compelling as they might be, they aren't justification for a VA claim. \n\n3. Treatment: fortunately, you already have access to adequate treatment. I hope you're taking advantage of it.\n\nI realize there may be more to the situation than that...just responding to what you've told us.",
    "Response_3": "1. I have the proof from medical and treatment records to satisfy the requirement for 100%. I guess my wording could've been better. What I meant was as tortureous as it is to work due to my disabilities, it wouldn't matter if I were at my current GS position or working at a gas station. It's going to be hell for me either way. Back in 2011 I tried to switch jobs, positions until my condition started progressively getting worse, regardless of my ongoing treatment. \n\n2. I'm not looking to get more money or scam the government. This is real. Unfortunately, I just can't up and walk away from everything. For example, I also have total social impairment. I have a young daughter. Should I just walk away from her because of my own conditions? Same way with a job. \n\n3. I have been in continuous treatment since discharging from the service. As you know, some providers are better than others.\n\nThere is a lot more. Years of treatment, problems and life crap. I just don't think I, or anyone else for that matter, should settle for their current rating if their conditions are progressively becoming more and more debilitating due to service related incidents/conditions.",
    "Response_4": "I was just awarded 100 percent PTSD (increased from 50).I submitted a DBQ from my VA counselor, a DBQ from my private psychiatrist, treatment summary from my VA counselor and my statement. I had been progressively getting worse and couldn't get to work anymore let alone perform my duties. Good luck!",
    "Response_5": "I agree with Old Medic, if you dislike your minimum GS job seek another job, maybe getting another job and your treatment may help you. A minimum paying job and 80% pays a little more then 100% alone. If you file for increase you would include the Voc Rehab report, Good or bad as you can't cherry pick. Good luck"

    "Question": "My VA psych has me on Trazadone and I just hate it.\n\nEven after several tweaks of dosages, etc. still having a hangover feeling and headaches.\n\nAnyone else have issues and are now on something better?\n\nThanks",
    "Response_1": "I was on that and Seraquil (sp?) before PDRL retiring, they made me feel sick and hungover. I had my MH doc switch my script.",
    "Response_2": "I have to ask, are you using it day or night? My doc put me on a combo of Citalopram for day, and Trazodone at night, which works like a charm. One picks me up, and one puts me to sleep. The Traz helps with my nightmares, which used to be sharp and intense, but now mellow out to long, weird, storytelling dreams that seem to last all night. Yes, in the morning, I feel slightly more groggy than taking nothing, but nothing that a cup of coffee and watching the sunrise can't fix.\n\nIt might come down to if you are trying to work a day job while on Trazodone. I am P & T, so don't go out of my house much except to buy groceries. I wouldn't suggest Trazodone for anyone who doesn't want or need a sedative effect.",
    "Response_3": "Trazodone is more commonly used to help you sleep better. One of the many problems that Depression, Bi-Polar Disorder and PTSD causes is disrupted sleep. Trazodone helps restore your sleep pattern with helps in treating depression, etc.",
    "Response_4": "I wake up a little \"sluggish\" (or sometimes VERY \"sluggish\"). I handle this by taking a shower as soon as I get out of bed, dressing, and then having 2 cups of coffee. That \"restores\" me to normal.\n\nI hesitate to ask for any change, because my drug regimen works for me. I used to have terrible rages, over the littlest thing. My wife hated to see that happen, and to endure the yelling (I just yelled and screamed, I never got violent, thank God). Once I got on my drug cocktail, that went away, and I do not EVER want it to come back!",

    "Question": "PTSD dropped from 70 to 0 due to alcohol use disorder? I don't drink!\nI had an appointment in February for my first PTSD rating. I had a 70 percent rating when I got out. My symptoms are worse. I spent 2 hours almost with the rating doc. I just got a letter saying they have dropped my service connected PTSD and Major Depression rating from 70 to 0. They said my symptoms are no longer caused by PTSD. They're caused by \"alcohol use disorder.\" The issue here is that I rarely drink. And because of my medications for PTSD and tbi among other things, I don't drink at all. I've never been in trouble or had any issues with alcohol. I have no idea where they're getting this. But of course since that isn't service connected I'm losing that too. I don't know how any of this ads up. I remember the doc asking if I drank and I told him maybe 3-4 times a year. Now I guess I have to appeal it somehow. Can someone explain how this happened?",
    "Response_1": "Just pointing this out (not digging on you) 1. You rarely drink. 2. You never drink. 3. Drink 3-4 times a year. You can appeal the decision and they should give you time to do so. They may have mixed up your exam with someone else. Won't be the first time I have heard his. But get the facts straight...giving mixed signals with only your post here. Imagine what the rater is dealing with.",
    "Response_2": "Your situation shows EXACTLY why it is important to notify BOTH the VA Regional Office and your VA Healthcare provider of any change of address. It is preferable to do this in writing (an actual letter, sent in an envelope with a stamp on it). Forwarding can take a long time, and sometimes things get lost in the process.\n\nYOU NEED A VSO, AND YOU NEED ONE RIGHT NOW! Trying to work on this by yourself is NOT a good idea, since t is apparent that you really don't know the system. VSO's work for free, and they can be invaluable. Your letter should tell you how to appeal this decision, so get on this right away.\n\nDon't sit around trying to figure out what to do. Get your butt to your local VA Medical Center, or the VA Regional Office, and get a VSO on this matter as fas as you possibly can.",
    "Response_3": "I'm 50% for PTSD and did a stint in rehab for alcohol. A couple years later i had a review and the only thing that changed was \"alcohol dependence\" was added secondary to my PTSD. My rating never changed. I'd guess this is just an error.",
    "Response_4": "Have your current therapist write a summary letter describing your symptoms (and how long they have persisted).  Might be a good idea to printout the PTSD DBQ and give it to your therapist, so that you keep the doctor focused on the same elements that the C&P examiner focused on, and then submit the letter with your NOD.  Good luck.",
    "Response_5": "First and foremost VA doesn't just send you a letter telling you that they have dropped your evaluation from 70 to 0 percent unless this has no effect on the amount of your compensation.  They send you a letter proposing such an action and offer you the opportunity to submit evidence that rebuts the proposed action.  So I suggest we try again.  Is this your first notice from VA and if so, exactly what did it say?"

    "Response_1": "I was asked to try Prolonged Exposure, after finishing up 12 sessions of Cognitive Processing Therapy, but I'm not climbing back down in that hole. I have a hard enough time trying to think my way out of stuck points when they happen, so I know I'm not going to relive war hell day in and day out. No way! So my shrink has me coming in for a one on one with her every couple weeks. Good luck with whatever road you choose.",
    "Response_2": "http://www.slate.com/articles/health_and_science/medical_examiner/2015/07/prolonged_exposure_therapy_for_ptsd_the_va_s_treatment_has_dangerous_side.html",
    "Response_3": "I can talk about sh** all day with my VA psych. and walk out of the room like nothing happened, for the most part.\n\nBut later that day or the next I am so F'd Up I go into this strange mixed emotion state.\n\nOne minute crying or having a good panic attack and then wanting to throw stuff across the room.\n\nI'm sure all of us process differently, but this method does not sound like something I want to do.",
    "Response_4": "I went through the program. I am about to be interviewed by the VA for completion of the program. I can say that in many ways it helped me. I wanted it to help. However, I can relate to almost every poster before me. Many memories were hidden away. It will dig it all up. I wake up screaming so says my wife.\n\nThe good is that I have found a new way to be happy. But I am still not social.\n\nGood luck to you.",

    "Question": "Denied PTSD due to MST\n\nWell I went on Ebenefits and my case is now closed.  They are saying, from what I see on the webite, my case is denied.  I submitted buddy letters, my own account, and the VA Medical Center in Loma Linda said that I have PTSD related to MST.  For some reason the rater saw fit to deny my claim.  Although I'm upset, I'm not done fighting.  I just don't know what other info I can give them to sway the decision in my favor.  I am thinking of getting a letter of Nexus from a non VA doc but money is so tight.\n\nMST claims, from what I've read, don't need \"proof.\"  What I've supplied is what I have.  Sexual assault wasn't something that a person run and told the police about.  Expecialy in the 90's and in the Army.  I'll see what the letter says when it gets here and just continue to plug away.  It helps to have police reports, etc. etc. but nothing I can do about that now.  I'm being seen by the VA and have been for over 4 years for Chronic PTSD, Anxiety disorder, and major depression.",
    "Response_1": "I have a buddy statement that speaks to my increase in drinking as well as performance issues.  The person that wrote my letter was informed on the day it happend as well.  I submitted a letter from a family member as well that stated how I was before and after serving.  If I had a time machine I guess I would have done more LOL.",
    "Response_2": "That isn't entirely true.  While it isn't necessary to have absolute proof that something happened, it also isn't enough that someone simply says it happened.  There should be some \"markers\" to support the assertion.  For example, when people suffer extreme trauma it normally manifests itself in the form of behavioral or psychological changes that are apparent to people around them.  VA will look at things like personnel evaluations to see if there is any change following the claimed trauma or perhaps disciplinary reports.  They look for some evidence that something traumatic happened to the person at the time in question.\n\nFrom what you are saying my hunch is that the claim was denied because there was nothing to support your assertion that the event happened.  That doesn't mean that they don't believe you, but they simply can't grant claims like this without something to back it up.  If they did they would have claims up to their ears that they would have to grant from less than honorable people who just want some money.",
    "Response_3": "I was awarded 70% PTSD for MST last year. Initially when I retired in 2010 I was awarded 50% for depression based on years of being in and out of psychological counseling while in service and very erratic NCOER's. I wasn't prepared to discuss the MST at time of retirement and refused to include it in my claim despite urging from the VA counselor. Finally, I was able in 2015 to submit a claim. As documentation I had 1.) Orders reassigning me from my company 2.) A note from the post CSM of the installation I was assigned to at the time informing me he'd spoken to my battalion SGM and if my issue wasn't resolved w/i a week to come back and see him (I'd had to seek his assistance due to my chain of command not being responsive to my complaint and labeling me a \"troubled\" soldier\"....I was reassigned w/i days of speaking to him), 3.) ER visit medical document where I'd been seen after an assault, 4.) Medical record verifying I'd attended mandatory family counseling following an assault.\n\nOddly enough, this paperwork was over 20 yrs old but for some reason I still had it.  I kept it because I still till this day keep the personal, hand written note from the post CSM and the reassignment orders as a personal victory I won in the military despite several traumatic events I lost.\n\nGood luck w/your appeal.",
    "Response_4": "It simply isn't enough to walk in and claim a MST...there must be some smidgen of evidence that the act occurred, otherwise there would be no claim process at all...just award 100% and case closed.  It can't happen that way, anymore than IHD can be claimed and awarded when it occurs 40 years after the service ends.\n\nMST happens, I'm sure.  However, just presenting a story/account of an alleged assault will usually not be acceptable.  That seems reasonable, don't you agree?",
    "Response_5": "never give up Cruiser and Cavmedic are absolutely right you need something other than your say so. I am sorry to hear about your denial but my advice to you is to keep looking. I was just awarded my claim for PTSD/MST this month@ 70%. I filed my claim in June 2015 without the help of a VSO but with the wonderful help of VBN (shout out). I started this journey on a wing and a prayer and then I started looking, like you I didn't report, there was no trip to the officials or the doctor but in my briefcase filled with papers from 1981-1984, I found a 1983 calendar which I had noted the date of the event a letter of response from my friend who I told ( I sent the original because it was a little faded) performance records after the event, I also sent buddy letters from people who knew me before and after who evidenced my behavior after my violation. When I started I was told to visit the VETWOW website, I didn't, I stayed in the background of VBN and I watched( lurked) because this is the best place for all of your claim needs, these guys are great. I decided not to attempt IU because the thought of another C&P terrifies me as I am still reeling from my first one. Stay strong Cliff and start looking. GOD BLESS!"

I am currently at 50% PTSD and 10% tinnitus. I have filed because since being rated in 2012 however, filed in 2010, I have dropped from school/voc rehab program 3 times over the past 3 years and I have lost two relationships. I'm now bouncing around houses and will be living in a friends business with no other real plan about the future. It seems what I hate most is my PTSD causes me to have an inability to form rational thoughts when stress levels get to high. I have uncontrollable anger outbursts when I feel threatened in all areas, occupational and socially. I considered my school/voc rehab program to be occupational since I was not working. Honestly I don't feel as though I am able to work and I struggle with reliability. Triggers.....going outside. I withdraw from society to lessen my stress. I am seeking treatment currently. I have a history of tried medications with no success and have attempted Prolonged exposure therapy with no success either and am now in Cognitive processing therapy. I'm not sure if my counselor is responsible but last meeting I told him I was homeless and he said these types of claims go to the top and I received a phone call with a scheduled appointment. Is this coincidence? Anyhow, what should I expect this time at the psychiatric evaluation? I feel I'm 100% and my life is getting very tiring. I'm venting/sharing/asking for advice. Anything would help.",
    "Response_1": "Your comment about considering school/voc to be occupational is good if that is what works for you even if it is only a little. I believe that the medications are hit and miss because they work on a certain percentage of patients that take them. So, the best thing is to of course follow Drs orders and hopefully you will come across a medication that will smooth things out for you. \n\nLuckily, I was prescribed a low dose of setip... (or something) and I think it works for me. I read your symptoms and it really struck a chord with me because I was going through them pretty bad I thought my wife was going to leave me suicide outburst perception etc. I still have some rough patches, I see (so does wife) a difference with the meds. I also took it upon my self to rid the world of evil on a game called Diablo III. Usually after killing monsters for an hour or two I can let things that annoy me slide. \n\nOccasionally, at work I was having some personality conflicts with some co-workers (always someone different) so I asked if there was a way I could be around a few less people and they accommodated me. \n\nI have heard about \"hardship cases\" and yours sounds like one. I don't know what kind of matrix that the VA uses for determination as to which cases are and arn't hardship. Try googling it.\n\nI wish you the best of luck. You're doing the right thing by looking for advice from those that been there done that.",
    "Response_2": "You have a relationship with your vocrehab/vetsuccess center ? If your councilor has gotten to know you and the symptoms your presenting as descrined above term she can help you by evaluating your employability. They are trained to be able to spot your disabilities affect on your life. They have a vested interest in seeing you succeed in their program and may be overlooking the severity of your symptoms that may call for them to do a redirection in their assessment. \n\nI was denied availability to the vetsuccess/vocrehab program twice because I am unemployable in there eyes (that's a different story) \n\nWhat I am getting to,... your councilor reevaluating your case & saying you are no longer qualified to Voc rehab and are unemployable would put your I/U 70%PTSD or 100% PTSD in the very firm category. VA docs are not so prone to put down they think your enemployable but part of Voc rehabs job is to evaluate that. \n\nYour History with your councilors help in the illustration of the symptoms you described above. If your vocrehab plan is aggravating your symptoms you need to let them know and see if it is still a viable option, If not you fall into the category I am in.\n\nbeing disenrolled from voc rehab also means no income, \n\nIt seems to be different for different areas but in my area you are in voc rehab(school) because you have \"viable\" employable potential.\n\nso you see the delima here, waiting for that IU to come through could take over a year depending on where you are. (I am 4 years 2 months because of a bad C&P, i am in appeal status)\nI had 2 docs say i was umeployable, SSDI given and rejection from voc rehab because they didnt see me as \"viable\" I was given 50% PTSD\nyou being a poential homeless could expedite your claim but that dint help me and i was in forclosure but I am also in Florida.\nof course you should be talking to your shrink about this and be frank and ask him what he thinks about your future prospects with employ.\n\nmake sure you get your ducks in a row and be prepared for a long road if they dont give it to you first round.\nand I maybe way off on this because I only have my experience to compare it to. There are many here who have seen this 100 different ways.",

    "Question": "New PTSD/TBI claim advice\n\nI have been reading on here alot and its been very helpful just wanted to get some input/advice. I'm currently on active duty and meeting with the VSO through our VA rep on base rep to start my claim on tuesday. I have all of my documentation to support PTSD and currently diagnosed by Navy Mental Health for PTSD from 2 combat tours to AFG 2010-11 and 2012. I waited till my last 2 years on active to finally get help for PTSD and get checked out for TBI from IED explosion in 2011 and they told me i have Mild TBI. My questions are what is the process once i get a date for my claim to start beeing checked out and is there any thing I should be aware of before going to my appointments any tips things to watch out for. I've been reading alot of people being disqualified for PTSD and the head aches of trying to appeal it. With the TBI i haven't been able to see how they actually rate that is it tied into PTSD raitings i know the symptoms over lap just trying to get some info thanks.",
    "Response_1": "First welcome to the site and thank you for your service.\n\nIt's easy file your claim for the issues you have, ensure the VARO get's all the medical evidence you have to support your claim. Once your C&P exams are scheduled, go to them and tell them what happened. Be honest and up front with them.",
    "Response_2": "The PTSD/TBI thing seems to be hit or miss. Mine were rated separate, because I had visible damage to my brain (comparative CT scans) and the symptoms were clearly and independently separate. So it is possible to get 2 ratings. In some cases, the symptoms cannot be clearly separated. Which means the line is blurred on where TBI ends and PTSD begins. In those cases they are usually acknowledged you have but but get one single rating. I'm not sure if there's a magical formula for this, or if you just get the higher rating.\n\nYou already got the best advice, just go in and be honest, and the C&P examiner note your comments, and their analysis.\n\nGood luck!",
    "Response_3": "Of primary importance to YOU is to get a complete copy of ALL of your service medical records before you get out. That includes any hospital stays, if you were sent to an outside source for something, etc., etc.\n\nThose records are the primary basis of virtually any claim that you may make in the future. You NEVER throw those records away, or give them to anyone else. If some (like a VSO) wants to see them, MAKE A COPY and let them read the copy.\n\nTBI's may or may not, be tied to PTSD. Both are mental conditions, it is just one (the TBI) is caused by physical damage to the brain, while the other (PTSD) is caused by psychological damage to the brain.\nSometimes the symptoms overlap so much that there is no way to separate the symptoms of one from the other. Other times, you can separate at least SOME of the symptoms, and then you can get rated for each separately.\n\nAs to getting a rating for PTSD, the single most common reason to NOT get Service Connection for it, is because the person never sought any treatment for it. Years after they get out of the military, they claim PTSD, but they have absolutely no medical record to substantiate that they actually have the disorder.",

    "Question": "I had my appointment with my doctor today. I have combat PTSD since 2008. I have been in therapy once a week since 2011 and doing groups.\n\nim not getting much better. I have done EMDR....NO HELP. I am on lots of meds. They help some. Now she wants to start me on two new programs.\n\nthe first one is CPT and the second one is PE ?   Does anyone have any experience with these? Did it help for you? Any input would be most appreciated. Thank you.",
    "Response_1": "I went through Prolonged Exposure Therapy...Intense is an understatement.  In my opinion your success depends a lot on the therapist.  I was fortunate to have a very good one.  Probably the toughest thing I have done to date in treatment but well worth it in the long run.\n\nI haven't gone through CPT.  Hopefully no one is suggesting you do both at once!!!  PE is all consuming\n\nGood luck Brother",
    "Response_2": "I did CPT fir about 5 years. At first twice a month, then once a month for that last 2. Really helped me. I'm still on lexapro, still have my triggers, but less, and less intense. \n\nBut, everyone is different. I had a great therapist that I really like. Agree with above, the key is the therapist, and the therapist-client relationship. \n\nGood luck.",
    "Response_3": "I completed a 12 week CPT group session - we started with 15 participants, three of us completed the session - so that kind of tells you the success rate, at least in doing what the group therapy requires - most of your time will be identifying and exploring how your traumatic experiences have changed your thought and beliefs, and how some of these ways of thinking keep you \"stuck\" in your symptoms. CPT does not involve repeatedly reviewing the details of trauma like PE. You will write a lot about how your past experiences have currently affected your thoughts, feelings, and behaviors. \n\nParticipating in CPT helped me a lot - I can now recognize when I'm in one of my \"stuck points\" in the way I respond to life activities and now have some tools to change my thinking - change your thinking, change your world. But as Spunky says, \"everyone is different.\" \n\nBest wishes to you, Ptsd100",
    "Response_4": "Unfortunately, the number of people that \"completed\" a program has little to do with its success rate.\n\nPeople drop out of such programs for a very wide variety of reasons. They may, or they may not, actually get involved with the kid of treatment being provided. Having done group therapy for over 50 years, I can tell you that a significant number of the people in groups simply don't want to be there, and are there for some reason other than getting better.\n\nOther peoples success, or failure, in any form of treatment has absolutely NO predictability of how YOU might do with that treatment.",

    "Question": "PTSD....afraid to work\n\nI am 100% disabled, 70% PTSD.  I haven't worked since Spring 2014.  Prior to that I had a job working overseas for 3 yrs (2010-2013)  which I absolutely LOVED!!  Received great customer evals as well as a good review from boss.  New boss came in and within a year, I was fired because of \"failure to be a team player\" (after 3 yrs?!!!).  Didn't see it coming.  I came back to US and utilized my GI Bill to go to school full time.  In Mar 2014 I was hired in a doctor's office (my DREAM job w/excellent pay).  Interview went well, was offered a higher position that I was initially called in to interview for.  Was hired w/a promise of intent to promote in 1 yr after training.......was fired after 3 week because apparently I didn't \"fit\" with the other 2 girls in the office.   This came totally out of the blue.  There were no arguments, disagreements, write ups nothing.....I had NO idea there were issues b/myself and other staff  in the office.   I had problems throughout my military career getting long w/other due to failure to bond (I had 2 MST incidents early in military career that detroyed my ability to trust or get close and bond w/others).  \n\nLong story short, I am TERRORFIED of entering the work force again, as I have been traumatized by being fired from the only 2 jobs I've had post military.  I am a very self aware person but have no idea what it is I'm doing to turn co-workers off to the point I'm being fired.  I am quiet but do engage when engaged.  Any suggestions?",
    "Response_1": "1. You need to be in treatment, probably significantly more treatment than you have been getting.\n\n2. You need to be honest about your PTSD with your treating people: how it is affecting you; how it affects your interactions with others; your feelings about working with others, what YOU experienced when you went into that last work setting, and how things changed when you go a change in boss; about your internal fears, feelings about people in a supervisory position over you and just how you interact with coworkers, friends, acquaintances, strangers, family, etc., etc.\n\nIt is entirely possible that on your overseas job, you changed significantly after your old boss left. I have seen that happen with a lot of people, both with and without PTSD. BUT, with people that have untreated or inadequately treated PTSD, this can often have a VERY profound effect on their work performance and their ability to work with others.\n\nTreatment should be your number 1 goal in life right now. There is absolutely no reason why you should not be able to successfully reenter the work force, once you have YOUR demons under control.",

    "Question": "PTSD diagnosis\n\nHow should PTSD be diagnosed? My husband has been in 15 yrs & deployed 5 times. I started noticing problems when he returned from the last deployment appx 4 yrs ago. I could never get him to say anything to the Dr. until now. He spoke to his PCM re: some issues during his last visit. The PCM scheduled him an appt with a behavior health provider in that clinic. Today was his first visit with the behavior health provider, & it didn't go so well. She gave him a piece of paper to fill out & graded it according to what he marked. She stated he didn't pick enough on the questioner to say he has signs of ptsd. She basically gave him a booklet on anger management & said to come back in 3 wks. Some of the things he discussed; road rage, anger, not sleeping, tired, anxiety in crowds, nightmares, inability to focus & forgetfulness. Does this sound right? Could it just be anger problems & not ptsd?",
    "Response_1": "There is very specific criteria for PTSD diagnosis, and it's pretty strict. You have to basically meet X amount of criteria.\n\nDuring my initial claim I was rated 50% for Depression, Anxiety, and insomnia. 80% with other disabilities. \n\nAfter C&P for IU and new TBI claim, they made me do another Mental Health C&P. My MH rating was changed to 70%, because the C&P Doctor and my long term VA records (1 year treatment) said my condition more closely represented combat related PTSD at the 70% level. So I think it can sometimes fix itself with patience and a good solid record of what's actually going on with the individual.",
    "Response_2": "Those are almost the exact same problems I was having and continue to have.  My therapist said it wasn't PTSD.  I filed a claim for anger, depression, and anxiety.  I was denied all of those and rated for combat related PTSD.  Go figure.",

    "Question": "Asking for increase in rating for PTSD.\n\nI was originally rated at 50% for PTSD.  I felt that it should have been higher but I didn't want to rock the boat.  This was 2 years ago, I feel that my condition has slowly deterioated.  I can no longer work a full time job becasue of the added stress that it casues me.   I have been unable to keep a full time job. I work part time to help me pay the bills.  I have had four Psychiatrists and all of them have their own theory for treatment.  I have looked at the Criteria for 70% and I think that I qualify with the exception of Suicidal/Homocidal tendencies, even though I entertain the toughts.  I have had multiple med changes and med dosage increases.  I have been terminated from several jobs due to issues with my coworkers and my supervisors.  I want to ask for an increase to 70%  but do I need a DBQ from my treating Psychiatrist?  I asked him but he said that he doesn't have the time, he sais that they, the Board, can read his notes.  DO I need a DBQ for an increase or will his notes be sufficient? Please anyone with knowledge on this issue please drop me a line.",
    "Response_1": "In looking at the rating criteria, keep in mind you don't have to have every symptom for a particular rating level. Hell, a lot of folks rated for 100% PTSD don't have suicidal/homicidal tendencies.\n\nIf you file a claim for an increase, the VBA will likely order a C&P to take care of the DBQ...if they determine one is needed, given the medical records/notes. If a C&P is ordered, the examiner providing the DBQ would have access to all your records/notes.",
    "Response_2": "I think you need to compile what I call a life log where you record on a regular basis the problems you are having and incidents such as being \"let go\". This way when you see your doctor you will be able to provide specifics. Any paperwork you have with regard to your terminations length of time worked,reason for termination and such things will help you. Your part time work may affect the decision they make in your case. Marginal work or work where your salary doesn't amount to \"gainful employment\"( below the poverty line) will probably not be considered.\nA letter from a private Doctor listing your limitations and an opinion on whether or not you will ever be able to hold full time gainful employment would be the best evidence backed up by your medical records.",

    "Response_1": "Filing for an increase will not affect your employment. One is highly unlikely to know about the other unless you request IU status, which would probably be denied since you're maintaining substantial gainful employment.\n\nIf you decide to quit, well that's your decision. I don't know how you plan to support yourself though. Even if you got a PTSD increase to 70% it isn't enough to live on... Try not to make hasty choices.",
    "Response_2": "Not taking meds prescribed by your MH doctor and expecting to get better is like running a two cycle engine on straight gas (with out the oil) and expecting the machine to function properly.  Your doctor is trying to find the correct drug to get your brain back into the proper balance but if you either do not take the meds or don't tell the doctor what the meds do to you, then you are working against your mental health and not for it.  Good luck but I would have a heart-to-heart discussion with my doctor and abide by his advice.",
    "Response_3": "Pain that is untreated WILL make depression, PTSD, Anxiety and all other mental health conditions WORSE. In many cases, it will make those conditions a LOT worse. Refusing any form of pain medication if you have any significant amount of pain is a strange choice to make. But, its your life, and if you choose to hurt, that's your choice.\n\nAs far as your PTSD is concerned, it is absolutely vital that YOU communicate clearly with your doctor about how any medication, or combination of medications is affecting you. They are NOT mind readers, and they have no way of knowing unless YOU tell them.\n\nRefusing to take medications, or deciding what, if any, medications you WILL take is your choice. It is YOUR life. If you prefer to live it in pain, being irritable, angry, depressed, on edge all the time, etc., etc., that is a valid choice. But, in making that choice, you are condemning yourself to a pretty miserable life.\n\nThere is no known \"natural\" method of treating PTSD that has been shown to actually work. There are lots of claims out there, but no unbiased study has ever shown any of them to help, EXCEPT for Meditation. Meditation can help, but it is no \"CURE\". No herbs, supplements, etc. have ever been shown to work on mental disorders.\n\nIt is YOUR life, and YOU can choose to live it however you choose.",

My symptoms controlled me for 50 years or so. With a combination of meds, group and one-to-one therapy, the PTSD and other mental health issues don't control me 100% of the time. Hell, I went to my first concert since the Monterey Pop Festival in the 60s the other night. It is however a day to day struggle, with some days being better or worse than others.\n\nYou do have a choice - let the demons control you, or with the help of others and maybe some medications, you control the demons.",

And at age 51 I feel like 85 years old. \nI only take Tylenol that the VA gives me. Last thing I need is to deal with an addiction to pain pills. SO I just deal with the pain as best I can. \n\nMy personal unprofessional opinion is that quitting work may cause you to become even less social and isolated and may cause your PTSD symptoms to get worse....as well as depression.

    "Question": "Help with PTSD naturally\n\nHello,\n\nAre there any recommendations to deal with PTSD symptoms like anxiety and paranoia that does not include medications?  I also have pain but the strongest stuff I take is Advil.  \n\nI would like information on a wholistic natural healing group therapy or something of the sort.  Thanks",
    "Response_1": "The short answer is YES, with a great big BUT involved.\n\nMeditation can help, but you really need to know how to do it. It is not as easy as many people think it is. It is NOT just sitting in a quiet place and going \"Ummmmm\". It involves clearing the mind, and for people with anxiety, that is often a VERY difficult thing to do.\n\nBehavioral therapy works very well for anxiety, for most, but not all, people. You need to have a therapist that knows what they are doing, or you can end up worse off.\n\nIf you can afford it, multiple \"talk therapy\" appointments every week work for SOME (but not most) people. This approach is VERY expensive, and the vast majority of health insurance plans will NOT cover it.\n\nHerbs and supplements have NEVER shown any appreciable effect on PTSD or any other mental disorder, in double blind studies (the ONLY kind of studies that actually mean anything). Double blind studies are those in which neither the subjects, or the people handing out the \"substance\" know what they are getting. The \"medications\" look identical, except for some kind of number, letters or symbol.\n\nThe single most effective form of treatment for both PTSD and Anxiety is to let the pros work WITH you on what will work best for YOU. Medications do NOT change who you are, and if they are properly administered, they release you from the crippling effects of your mental disorder., with no other significant effects. Medications, to be effective, REQUIRE that you communicate with your treating people. What works for \"most\" people, may not work at all for you. Your body chemistry is unique to you, and if you do not tell your treating people how a medication is affecting you, that is YOUR fault.\n\nTo just flat out reject the use of any medication doesn't make a lot of sense.\n\nIt is YOUR life, and you can choose to live it however you choose. If you decide that living with pain, with anxiety and with the effects of PTSD, while refusing the number 1 treatment for those conditions, is the way to go, that is YOUR choice and it's a valid choice. Just understand that you are severely limiting the effectiveness of possible treatment by making that choice.",

Anything to feel even a hair better.\n\nI don't know much about natural healing, but I can lend a trick. If you have a nearby military installation and access to it, try going to the PX. I still can't walk into a Walmart, but I force myself to shop the PX and Comisary. All the uniforms (fellow military and retired) help reduce the anxiety and guarded hyper vigilance a little. It allows me to get into a public setting without feeling completely unsafe. Maybe it would help you too.",
    "Response_3": "I agree with the input of all the fellows who commented. I think it is wise to follow a multi pronged approach in trying to heal your self. I have been helped by medications, mental health professionals, interacting and staying close to combat veterans who are close friends. Finally I think self help goes a long way. As I have aged over the past 45 or so years I have begun to understand human beings and human nature. My recommendation is to not beat up on yourself and if you are carrying around bitterness,hate, or resentment try to get rid of it. It tends to poison a person. I wish you a long and happy life.",
    "Response_4": "Meditation has been recommended by my therapist.  However, medication may be your best shot (if it is the correct medication).  Meds are to correct a chemical deficiency in the brain (normally) and, if correct, help the person.  Sometimes, it takes awhile to get the meds correct.  Good luck on what ever you decide!",

Is it better to get diagnosed before you leave the service, does it make the process for claims easier because it has already been identified? I am on the road to retirement and I have all these appointments and now they are checking my brain so on and so forth? I just wanted to ask if it was better to get it identified before you get out because I read about everyone's problems or struggles. Thanks for any input.",
    "Response_1": "Having it documented while on active duty is a good thing to do however. It helps to establish the length of time you have had this problem. In some cases, where the documentation is very clear, a VA doc will just sign off that you do indeed have PTSD, without a C&P exam.",
    "Response_2": "Two peices of good news. If documented in service it is easier to establish service connection. Also the Military has pretty tight standards for diagnosing PTSD which makes it far more likely a VA doc will give you a proper diagnosis.\n\nAnything documented in service can only help your claims. I encourage you to make sure EVERYTHING is documented before retirement. Go through your medical records and make sure no injury or illness was left out. Even things that don't bother you much may get worse later.",
    "Response_3": "The diagnosis of PTSD must be made by a VA psychiatrist or VA Clinical Psychologist...most like via a C&P exam arranged when you file a disability claim.  Now, having it all documented ahead of time is a good idea, but in a VA claim, it must be diagnosed by VA.",
    "Response_4": "With regard to service connection, The only difference between PTSD and any other mental disorder is that PTSD is recognized as having a delayed onset which means that it isn't necessary that the condition manifest while on active duty. In those cases all that must be shown on active duty is the stressful event that is the source of PTSD. In your case you have already manifested symptoms of a mental health problem while in service; therefore, you don't have to prove a stressor. In fact, even if the VA diagnosis is some mental health disorder other than PTSD it would still be service connected in almost all cases since it would simply be a difference of opinion over the correct diagnosis for a condition that clearly started while you were on active duty.",

    "Question": "Will FDC include treatment after the FDC is submitted? Financial Status Report Question\n\nI'm still in treatment for PTSD/Depression and wanted to know if my continuing treatment will be included in my claim after it is turned in as a FDC?\n\nI'm filing financial hardship with the possibility of homelessness. The lease my family and I have expires at the end of the month and we can't renew. Our financial situation is a disaster. Accounts are overdrawn have shut-off notices from utility companies. I have printed out all of my debts I have, my overdrawn checking account information, and eviction notices. Is there anything else I can do to expedite this process? \n\nI'm filing an increase for migraines. I have a DBQ filled out by my private neurologist. I have my FMLA hours used at work before I ended up losing my job. I have the paperwork saying I lost my job. A headache log. My neurologist wrote on the DBQ that \"The migraines effect his ability to sustain gainful employment\". I wrote a letter on behalf of myself, my wife wrote a letter, and my dad wrote a letter all saying what they've noticed (for all the claims I am submitting), does it sound like I'm missing anything for migraines?\n\nI put in for IBS under the gulf war presumptive. I'm 29 and included my recent colonoscopy findings. A diagnosis of IBS, diarrhea, and abdominal pain from my private physician. The statements from the above mentioned people wrote how IBS affects my life.\n\nFor PTSD it'll be more difficult. My PTSD incident happened on the flight deck of an air craft carrier when a sailor was killed and I was on watch. He was decapitated. I was responsible for operating the cameras that were on the flight deck. We saw the incident on the cameras and I had to play video back over and over and over for the officers that came in and needed to see it. After that there was a FOD walk down looking for body parts that could damage the jets. When I told this to the doctor he put in my notes that it doesn't meet the criteria for PTSD. Honestly I was offended by that because it seemed like the doctor was belittling it and it was very traumatic for all of us. A friend of mine who is now an NCIS federal agent and an army officer in the reserves wrote a statement for me recalling the incident to the best of his knowledge. And I had a walk-in mental health doctor say I was \"by the book\" while putting her hand on the book for PTSD. So I'm a bit confused by all of that.\n\nFor depression I had a diagnosis of it while enlisted. When I first applied for disability I had no idea what I was doing and applied for depression. They denied it saying I wasn't depressed at the time (I told myself I was fine) which is fair because I basically said I have my problems but I think I'm okay. Well that was 5 years ago and alot has changed in my life. I do have a current diagnosis of major depression and am on a few medicines for depression and migraines. \n\nSo this was supposed to be a question just about PTSD FDC and I got a bit carried away. I apologize I normally don't disclose this much information about myself or ask for help. Thank you in advance for any input.",
    "Response_1": "Filing a claim has NOTHING to do with obtaining medical treatment.  It is only after a person is found to be S/C for one or more conditions, that it has an effect on treatment.\n\nYou NEED to get your financial house in order.  If the situation is as bad as you say it is, then you may need to file for Bankruptcy.  Get your butt to a Bankruptcy attorney AS FAST AS POSSIBLE.\n\nStop making payments to anyone except for rent, utilities, NECESSARY medical care and food.  DO NOT USE ANY CREDIT CARDS AT ALL.\n\nDo NOT purchase anything, and I mean ANYTHING, that is not absolutely necessary.  If clothing is needed for kids, go to thrift stores. Don't purchase any precooked foods, and don't eat out at all. \n\nYou need to become like a turtle financially.  NOTHING comes out of your financial \"shell\" that is not absolutely necessary.  No cable TV, no NETFLIX, no fancy cellphone, etc., etc.  If you absolutely need a phone, use Trac-Fone, or something similar.  No games, internet access, etc. are NECESSARY on a phone.\n\nBeing in the kind of financial hell that you are in will make PTSD and Depression worse.  You need to get that load off of your shoulders, and you need to learn how to NEVER let yourself get into that kind of a situation again.  Personally, I pay CASH for everything.  If I can't pay cash, I wait till I can.  The ONLY debt that your should have is a mortgage.\n\nYou also need to be honest about your situation with your treating folks at the VA.  If your financial situation is as bad as you say it is, you can get Co-Pays waived, etc.  Any VA Social Worker can help you with that.\n\nYou also do NOT want to work on just one problem at a time.  You need TREATMENT and you NEED to get your financial house in order.",
    "Response_2": "Old Medic,\n\nThank you for your reply. Your words are not taken lightly I am doing everything I can to get our finances back to the way they were when I was working. Trust me we aren't using credit cards at all anymore and we don't have cable. Just internet for my wife's work. Good news though, I got a job offer! I would start April 4. I was offered a job at a large mortgage banking company (not sure if I'm allowed to say or not), and I will be working with veterans only in helping them through the home loan process start to finish. The huge drawback is the number of hours (min. 50), and my disabilities. I left my last job due to migraines. I worked in a casino as a dealer and the second-hand smoke was too much for my migraines to handle. I still haven't brought the total number down much but I'm at around 2 headache days a week now instead of the 3 - 6. I guess my biggest concern with this is I don't know if I can handle a job as demanding as this one for the long term, but I need the money so I HAVE to take it. Then the problem is when I file for IU on Tuesday (when I'm meeting the VSO to officially submit it if all is there), I'll be working by the time I have any C&P exams and from what I understand I won't qualify. My hope is that I can work here long term because the idea of having a job that helps vets all day sounds rewarding and I could use some positivity in my life. I do still have my concerns about the longevity of it all. But anyway OldMedic thank you for your legitimate concern, a lengthy response, and just being there to give me another nudge of \"get it together\". \n\nAlso my question about FDC and on going treatment is this. If I submit an FDC on say 3/1/2016 and my file isn't reviewed until 5/1/16 and I have treatment between 3/1 and 5/1 are those records going to be available for the rater to look at? I hope that's an easier way to understand it I'm not very good at making things clear.\n\nOh real quick, I have a FDC for migraines (my neurologist filled out the DBQ), and I'm filing for IBS as well. My stomach doctor \"isn't comfortable\" filling out the DBQ for IBS. I'm not sure why, he diagnosed me before I even knew that there was a presumptive. Anyway, I asked my primary care doctor (private) if he would be willing to look at my medical history and fill it out and he said he would be willing to do it. Can a PCP fill out a DBQ for IBS? (holy acronyms).",

    "Question": "Do I reopen my claim or...?\n\nHi, I really appreciate this network forum, since it helped me to go from 0% to a 20% rating for my skeletal issues in a very short time frame. However, now I have a question on my mental issues & I'm not sure what to do. \n \nAbout 18 months ago, I opened a claim for my PTSD/Anxiety/Depression (I was diagnosed by the VA with all of that about 6 years ago). However, with the claim, I never followed through with obtaining the evidence to support my link to \"in service\" claim; the evidence can be obtained, but I just didn't go through with getting it (I have a severe problem with sticking with things, which is why I go to the VA for help....off & on, of course).\n\n Either way, another VA doc diagnosed me recently with being Bi-polar. (I'm not sure if he did that in order to discredit my earlier PTSD diagnosises, but I'm meeting with him tomorrow & will ask him to clarify the diagnosis.)\n\n This week, I met with the DAV & they told me that my claim was denied because of no supporting evidence that it was linked to \"in service\". (which was because I didn't follow up with gathering the supporting evidence).\n\n My question is: \"Do I reopen the claim? And how? Or do I open a new claim...again, it appears that I also have a new diagnosis from being bi-polar, so is this now going to be a PTSD or a BIPOLAR claim with everything else being secondary?\"......the DAV told me to just write a letter to the VA, but the DAV has also given me some really bad advice, some of which took me years to straighten out.\n\n By the way, my PTSD was a result of a (non-service member) friend of mine that killed himself right before I went on a deployment. I started to see his ghost walking around the house & I went to see a Chaplain on base about it....even though I didn't respond to the VA letters for supporting evidence, I don't know why the VA says there was no supporting evidence, since I've been mentioning this for the past 6 years that I've gone to the VA psychiatrists.\n\nThanks for all replies.",
    "Response_1": "Mentioning it to VA docs and Therapists does not link it to being service connected. That's why they request evidence. You went to a chaplain. Maybe he wrote a report you came? Or he can write a letter validating you came? Iam no expert but just throwing things out there that may help you.",
    "Response_2": "I think you are confusing evidence requirements. While the VA may have diagnosed you with a mental health disorder, you have to give them evidence that it is connected to active duty. VA treatment does not equate to service connection. Hope that helps.",
    "Response_3": "If you have evidence of your in service stressor you could title your claim, \"Chronic acquired psychiatric condition to include PTSD and Bipolar Disorder\".  But it will be denied without strong evidence of the event in service.",
    "Response_4": "Chaplain's have 100% confidentiality and therefore don't always refer to mental health. The chaplain may not have taken notes or kept electronic notes. If the chaplain did it would not necessarily be documented anywhere in a military record. Best to contact him and see if he can send a letter about what you guys talked about.",

    "Question": "Phone call from VA today asking for any addition evidence?\n\nHello everyone,\n\nA few minutes ago, I received a phone call from a VA coordinator that said he specializes in ONLY sexual assault claims and that he was focused only in the MST portion of my current PTSD-MTS claim.  \n\nHe read me a prepared statement eg; Who he was and what his role was ect..., then he gave me a few details about the process and that I would get a letter in the mail asking for an additional signature allowing the release of information.  During our conversation, he asked about any additional information I might have that I need to send him.   I asked him if he had a chance to read my claim letter and if he had reviewed the recent emails between me and my commander.  He said that he had and that the time frame between the assault and the reporting date for that time period, was very common.    \n\nHe also mentioned that I may have an; \"additional future VA psychiatric examination, in order to move the adjudication process forward\".  In the package that I will be getting in the mail, he said he would provide me with a phone number where I could either contact him or leave a voice mail, as the claim process when forward, as he mentioned he worked out of his home two days of the week.  Additionally, he said that I would get information on different services and resources that were made available in 2001 (I think that was the date he mentioned) that will assist me thru this process.\n\nQuestion:\nIs is common to get a call like this from the VA?\n\nThanks in advance",
    "Response_1": "As I said, it all be legit, Doc...just sayin'...not every VA employee is wearing a halo...along the same lines, I know of a personnel office worker who takes names of incoming PCS personnel and either gives or sells them to real estate agents, car dealers, etc.  Those businesses then contact the PCSing veteran pitching a sale or asking to be their agent....happens more than we know where people have access to our addresses, phones, etc.",
    "Response_2": "Such telephone calls are NOT common, but they do happen. I got one during the processing of my 1151 claim, and was also suspicious. I refused to talk to the guy. He gave me the number of the Louisville Regional Office (which I already had, and he gave the correct number), and told me to verify that he actually worked there. \n\nI called the Regional Office myself, right after that call, and verified that the person actually worked there. I was connected to him, and discussed the things e wanted to know. He also read off a spiel about the fact that this call was being recorded, etc., etc.",
    "Response_3": "When developing this type of claim if there isn't enough primary evidence they are required to reach out to you for additional secondary evidence and then have the secondary evidence interpreted by an examiner and a medical opinion provided.

    "Question": "Have PTSD CP coming up..already diagnosed with PTSD at VA\n\nHi guys and gals..just have a few questions i hope you can help with.....or put my mind at ease about.  I have been diagnosed with chronic PTSD by the VA.  I have gone through CPT therapy and the VA is arranging fo rme to have further therapy.  Also on several meds.  I also have a lot of other physical issues from the service that I am rated for.  Pins in both knees, shoulder and left foot, tinnitus, lower back (4 herniated discs)and hyperthyroidism.  I was also diagnosed with anxiety when I was in but never claimed it.\n\nI pretty much stay at home except to go to the VA when I hav appts.  I was unable to find work when I got out due to my aggressive behavoir so have always relied on my physical abilities to do odd and end work.  SO kind of self employed.  As I have gotten older and my pain has grown\nworse I can no longer keep doing physical work.  So unemployed now. \n\nI was a Reconaissance Marine for 4 years then the Army in Psyops (37f) for 8 years.  My PTSD event happened at Ft Bragg.  I was involved in The Green Ramp Disaster.  Totaly screwed me in the head.  Some time later a guy from 82nd opened fire on all of us when we were doing PT. He killed 1 and wounded 20.  Sadly I had to be there for both of these events.  Green Ramp took my soul.  I have had issues every since.\n\nI am always scared a rater will say those are not good enough to give PTSD...although my therpaist tells me what I experienced was pretty far up there on the scale.\n\nSo anyway.  Will the CP rater read my notes from all my therapies?  Is the rater determining if I have PTSD (even though the VA already diagonsed me with it) \n\nThis is confusing for me.  I hate going through all of this anyway.  With all the physical issues and mental issues it sucks even being alive at times.  Feel like I am nothing but a burden to my family and feel they deserve better\n\nThanks for any input",
    "Response_1": "As stated this is likely open and shut case. PTSD can be caused by a number of things... So don't worry about them saying it's not enough. I have heard of ptsd symptoms just from bad experiences with leadership. I have combat related ptsd. Saw friends die, I've killed, I have horrible images in my head. All of that to me, probably pales in comparison to doing PT and having a fellow American troop going postal. I can't even imagine that scenario. If I had witnessed that, I would be double messed up. I can find solace these days, going on post, being around uniformed service members. Its the ONLY public type place I can go. I'm sure you don't even feel comfortable on a base anymore. I wish you the best, and I'm sure with those events looming, you'll be taken care of. God bless!\n\nWell, I'm just hoping you can find somewhere to feel safe other than your home. I use the surrounding installations as my safe place, that allows me to get out the house on occasion. Find yours so you don't go from PTSD hardships to being completely mad. At this juncture my goal is not to end up anymore nuts than I am lol.",
    "Response_2": "The initial examination for PTSD must be conducted by a VA (or contracted) psychologist or psychiatrist certified by the VA Office of Disability and Medical Assessment (DMA). \n\nMany therapists only have a master's degree.\n\nAlso, the VA almost always requires a C&P exam for vets claiming service-connected PTSD.",
    "Response_3": "Just tell the examiner how these events have ruined your life ,,just be honest...I am sure philly or cruiser will chime with expert information.\n\nThe cp examiner will have all your info and will likely have requests from the rater to ask you..it sounds like slam dunk. the exam is more of a formality..if your stressors are easily confirmed and plenty va psyc info dont worry..just be honest and dont hold back.\n\nGood luck bro..green ramp is well documented..i wouldnt sweat it..you will be fine..keeps us in the loop",

How Do I submit the correct way.  I had an Attorney and the DAV to submit it  \"SA secondary to PTSD\"  which is not correct.  I got denied, because the VA said the two don't connect.  This has been the best place for information.  Thanks in advance.",
    "Response_1": "At the current moment there is NO medical literature that states OSA is due to or part of PTSD. That is why the VA is denying claims for such. I know some people have been connected but that is because they were able to find a doctor who would state as much.\n\nAnd if you are able to get a doc to say PTSD caused OSA, they need to document how the PTSD changed your physiological make up i.e. cause the skin flap in your throat to increase in size which has lead to snoring and decreased oxygen intake.",

Sending any studies to the VA is a loser unless you are mentioned in the study.\nThat is not true.  There are studies that have concluded that PTSD can bring on SA.

I served multiple deployments to Iraq, and when I did my C & P exams, I was pretty specific about the incidents that occured while deployed, so I am surprised that it would show as Non-Combat. Is this anything that I should attempt to change? I have been receiving benefits for a little over a year without issue.\n\nThanks",

    "Question": "Dropping out of program with claim pending?\n\nI'm entering week 7 of 12 of Impact Clinic for PTSD.  I went thru this program also last year. I was doing therapy and didn't do it the way the Dr. wanted me to, I basically used grounding counting in my head.  So he tells me how messed up I am and maybe this therapy isn't for me.  I know from already going thru the course he is going to start talking about riders on my bus, which pisses me off.  Writing a letter to somebody that is supposed to be writing back (bullshit which never happened).  I didn't like it first time thru, so I only see it getting worse.  My Dr. Is head of PTSD for section at VA.  I also have a claim in final decision phase.  What should I do?  Ask for another program?  Bite my tongue and try to just stay out of discussion?  Drop out?",
    "Response_1": "Why are you wasting your time, and the Doctor's time, going through a program that you refuse to actually work with?\n\nIt is YOUR life, and if you want to continue living it all screwed up, that is a valid choice. It's a crappy choice but it's yours to make.  Just don't complain when YOUR choices don't work out very well for you.\n\nIf you actually want this to change, YOU are going to have to change your attitude, and start actually working on getting better.  Yes, being a firefighter is a wonderful job for many people.  They do a magnificent job of helping others.  BUT, it is NOT a good choice of occupation for a person that has your kinds of problems.\n\nYou are deliberately making choices that will make you feel worse.  You were told, flat out, that you should NOT go in and look at that suicide case.  Yet you chose to do exactly that, and you paid the price for doing so,  You caused harm to yourself, and helped add some more bad memories to torture yourself with.\n\nIf you decide that you actually would like to get better control of your symptoms, you will cooperate with treatment, you will get on medications to assist you with the process, and you will find a different occupation where you will NOT be so exposed to trauma.\n\nAs I said, it is YOUR LIFE, and you can CHOOSE to live it however you want to.  YOUR CHOICES will decide if that is one where you live with constant flashbacks, are miserable, and keep punishing yourself.  Or, they will direct you to work with your treating folks,  work to get your symptoms under control, and get on with a far more normal life.\n\nIt is largely in YOUR hands.  Choose which course of action will benefit you the most.",

My question is am I screwed because the C&P is the majority of my documentation?",
    "Response_1": "The fact that you have a documented TBI helps your case a lot. I have TBI and PTSD rated separately. But it's my understanding that they're often rated together, if it's hard to determine where one ends and the other begins. That may be favorable for you, since if you have a TBI rating, there is a good chance it can be increased or marked as total due to the PTSD as a residual of TBI.\nI think you're kind of in good shape on this one.",

During my deployment, I�ve encountered numerous events with ied�s and was awarded the CAB. During and after deployment, I never followed up with any appointments relating to TBI/PTSD/Mental Health issues because I didn�t want to go through the hassle since I was getting out soon (bad mistake on my behalf). For the next 1 � to 2 years (2011-2013), I did nothing, and by nothing I mean literally no jobs, no activities, and just trying to adjust back into civilian life. After obtaining and meeting up with my VSO, I decided to put in a PTSD claim. Claim was put in, had counseling with local VA psyche 2 times a month for 5 months, C&P exam, then was denied. Eventually appealed, and submitted new evidence by getting a second opinion from a private doctor recommended by my VSO. Received the letter recently and this is what the letter states:",
    "Response_1": "It's tricky. If your private doc didn't have your service medical records and just wrote what your told him, this dbq means nothing. Looks like that is what happened here. Secondly, a diagnosis of PTSD has to come from a VA provider. Now this may get you another c+p exam. You need a diagnosis, a nexus (with proof), and current disabilty. I would get a diagnosis from your VA provider.",
    "Response_2": "you have to get a diagnosis by a VA Dr., not a nurse/ phycologisr/counselor.  Seems like they are telling them not to give a diagnosis.  I also went to civilian Dr. and was diagnosed immediately.  I went thru  couseling for over two years straight and even had my psychologist write a letter stating I wasn't getting better and my nurse that prescribes my meds thru a Dr. diagnosed me.  It wasn't until I finally went inpatient for eight weeks that the Dr.'s gave me a diagnosis.  They used to just say I had really bad depression not caused by service.

    "Question": "mild tbi should I claim it?\n\nHello again,\n\nSo three or four years ago I was dx with mild tbi. I was also rated 100% ptsd. Should I put a claim for the mild tbi? I've had my rating of ptsd%for 3 years now? What are the pros and cons if I go ahead and file it. I already filed the mild tbi, but when the 100% ptsd was awarded, I cancelled the tbi claim, now I'm rethinking if I should reopen the mild tbi. \n\nThank you, any help would be appreciated.",
    "Response_1": "Tough call. Part of the symptoms of tbi overlap ptsd. I suspect a tbi claim will reopen your ptsd rating. Since you're already 100%, the only financial advantage is if all other ratings combine to 60%, then you're eligible for smc-s, which is about $250 extra a month. But you're risking $1000 a month is you drop to 90% overall rating.\n\nSince you first got 100% ptsd a couple years ago, it's highly likely you have a future exam on it anyway, normally 5 years from the decision letter. So I'd hold until you're up for a re-exam anyway. But, confirm with your VSO and go over your particular records/situation first!!",
    "Response_2": "get checked out and start treatment. If you haven't had a TBI screen at your VAMC request one through your PCM or your clinic Social Worker or your mental health provider. Since you have a personal history of a mTBI you should be able to get referred to your facility poly-trauma and physical rehab team pretty quickly.",
    "Response_3": "What these guys said. I would Also note that if you don't want to draw a possible reopening of your PTSD rating, that screening and treatment will keep a flow of documentation going. This would mean if you can't improve, you have a viable case for claim at a later date.",

My last 5 months worth of therapy sessions have been over my issues with a VA psychologist. I was informed that the VA rater is now requesting a new exam, specifically by a VA psychologist. I know that I am not allowed to record or have a third party present in the exam room with me. I requested to have my therapist present and was told that it would not be possible.\n\nI am now at a crossroads, while I have no intention of becoming violent or disruptive.

There are other avenues to pursue things that might not be truthful but you can't intimidate healthcare professionals into agreeing with you or writing what you want.

Interesting fact, you're better off with a VA Examiner. Contractors like QTC have such a high unfavorable review rate, there's actually conspiracy theories about them! I'm not joking, there are people who think they are paid to do unfavorable reviews or they do it to keep their contract by saving the VA money, and a number of other nonsense craziness.\n\nYou paranoia is going to do so much damage, you'll never dig your way out. As others have stated, you need some advanced level of treatment. I would suggest some inpatient help, just to level out your emotions.\n\nI'm not now, nor have I ever worked at the VA. Even someone who has, can't speak to the nature of each of their thousands of employees. BUT I can say, I've never felt I was being treated unfairly, or being victimized. I'm sure a lot of people here cv would say the same. That doesn't change the past or how you felt before. It should, however, give you confidence that you're unlikely to run into these problems again. Either the prior event was isolated, or in your head..\n\nC&P is the easiest part.

    "Question": "Inputs About Submitting a Claim for PTSD (I am Torn)\n\nI been having anxiety related issues since about 2003. (Waking up in the middle of the night not being able to breathe, hot flashes, feeling like I am having a heart attack, almost seizure like). As time went on, I noticed a significant issue with memory and speech, and panic attacks when driving (to the point I needed to pull over the side of the road sometimes), major migraines and vertigo. I was deployed to Saudi Arabia 2001 and Kuwait in 2002. I really didn�t experience any drastic events other than a few warning horns for SCUD attacks that woke me up in the middle of sleep to hit the bunkers. I also delivered munitions via convoy between Ali Al Salem AB and Al Jaber AB Kuwait.  The only other unfortunate event that happened was I had a troop that I worked with get shot dead by another troop. In 2003, I had an adverse reaction to the anthrax vaccine, and was deemed as being exempt from receiving the vaccine by a neurologist.=1em Since this time I have seen so many doctors about my symptoms, neurologists, headache specialist, and sleep specialists with no diagnoses other than migraines. I just chalked it up as issues from the antrax vaccine. In 2014, I went to see my primary care physician because I had a bad panic attack. He was the first physician that suspected I may have PTSD. I self-referred and saw a specialist for an evaluation in August 2015 (13 months after I retired).  The specialist had indeed diagnosed me with PTSD.=1em I really never considered PTSD as I didn�t think I encountered any situations that would cause PTSD. I still am having trouble understanding how I could have PTSD. My events are so insignificant to others I know. The VA sent me a letter to submit a claim for PTSD (because it doesn�t fall under the umbrella of general anxiety I guess).\n\nMy question is, in your opinion, are my events even worthy as service connected stressors? I am struggling with submitting a claim (even though I am experiencing symptoms) as many others have experienced much more dramatic events than I.\n\nThanks for any inputs.",
    "Response_1": "Significance of events is more dependant on who experiences them than what the events are. I have combat related PTSD and I don't think any less of your symptoms than my own. A problem is a problem no matter what angle you look from.\n\nAs far as worth filing a claim, I think it always is worth filing if YOU know it happened in service. The catch 20 is that you need to be able to prove it. Hopefully your service records reflect some or all of these things. I'm not sure if you saw doctors or sick call medics, but anything you can gather will be helpful for service connection.",

    "Question": "Is this common for PTSD?\n\nI was just wondering if this is common or typical for people that have been diagnosed with PTSD?  \n\nAfter waking up at 2:00am each day, because the Ambien wore off, I spend the next several hours walking around the house - showering a few times - surfing the internet watching videos of the US and Russians blasting ISIS\nI cant eat more than one time per day so I skip breakfast and lunch, saving my only meal for dinner.  (must be the Medication I am on?)\n\nSo then my girls get up for school and as me how I'm doing.  We chat for a bit and then they drive to school.\n\nMy wife then gets up, asked me to go for a walk, which I decline because it makes me too nervous (like being high up on an unstable ladder)\nLater on, I get ready to go to my VA behavioral health appointment.  I start this process several hours in advance.  Rechecking MyHealthyVet appointment times,   making sure I have my VA car in my wallet, deciding if I can drive or if my wife will need to drive me, changing my clothing several time to be sure I am dressed appropriately which required another shower (I almost never change clothing  without showering (clean or dirty clothing)).\n\nSo about an hour before I decide it is time for me to leave for my appointment, I start feeling very anxious, like I climbed up that same ladder another twenty floors.  My wife see this and tries to calm me.\n\nAs I walk toward the door of the house leading into my garage, I feel like I am walking against a powerful magnet keeping me from reaching the door.  By now, my wife is holding my hand as I slowly walk toward the door.  My breath becomes labored as I feel like I can't breath.  Like strange sensation of being pressurized with air and being squeezed to death at the same time.   Instantly, I am another several floors higher on the high ladder and I begin to feel damp from perspiration just trying to get to the garage.\n\nWithout getting into more details, I do eventually make it to my VA appointments without fail.  I am also able to get to the grocery store with my wife or children every two or three days...but it is really tough to do.\n\nIt is very difficult to feel like I am making much progress, however my OCD is much improved.  In Eckhart Tolle \"A New Earth - Awaking Your Like's Potential\" book that my EMDR doctor gave me to read, he mentions how to simply not think of the past or present negative things and to live in the positive present.  He makes it sound pretty easy, but it has been difficult for me to put into practice. \n\n\nAnyway, thanks for listening.",

Are you happy that you no longer have to go to work? I'm asking because I'm about to file for an increase due to total occupational and social impairment which can result in being rated at 100% for PTSD alone. I just wanted to get feed back from 100% rated PTSD veterans. I'm sure everyone thinks not going to work ever again is awesome but are they happy or content?",
    "Response_1": "I just spent a whole bunch of time writing our a really long reply and I hit \"post\" and it totally disappeared.\n\nI'm 35 years old and I recently stopped working and was awarded 100% for PTSD. The short answer is yes, I'm much happier and feeling better now that I'm not working. I can focus on treatment and my family and I've been putting a lot of my energy into art and hobbies. I'm in the process of buying a new house with my wife and I'm excited about diving into a whole slew of DIY work on the new house.\n\nI have two daughters (ages 5 and 7) and I've become very involved with raising my kids. I drop them off at school everyday, I help them with their homework, I spent more time actually playing with them and getting to know them, etc. I had a very cushy job working for the federal government as a chemist for the 5 years leading up to my 100% rating. In many ways I considered it my dream job. I was making decent money and I wasn't really working that hard. When I would tell people the sorts of things I was working people always thought it was a cool job. I miss the identity that comes with a semi-prestigious job, but towards the end I wasn't able to work anymore.\n\nMaybe at some point in the future I'll get back into working, but for the time being I'm very content and happy with the way my life is right now.",
    "Response_2": "I would give anything to leave the house and be able to work. I don't understand people that rate at 100% PTSD and function out of the house. It absolutely sucks being stuck in the house looking at a tv or staring outside day after day. Some days it gets to be so bad that I look at my gun safe wishing I new the combination!

    "Response_3": "For those with service connected total occupational and social impairment, a 100% rating can make the difference between having a stable living situation or living under an overpass somewhere.\n\nSo yes, that's a lot better. But not working can leave a huge void that many of us find difficult to fill...the idea of not working may sound awesome to some, but the reality falls far short, IMO, when you have no choice in the matter.",
    "Response_4": "If not granted 100% for PTSD alone, then yes, you should be able to work. The rub/ controvery appears when one is granted 100% for PTSD alone (which includes total occupational and social impairment). Most will say no to work yet a few will say yes, you can work being 100% PTSD. A pretty big gamble at any rate. But then if one can work (being rated 100% for PTSD) should he be rated 100%????",
    "Response_5": "I tell my friends, it's hard doing nothing all day. No, seriously, it is stressful. At first. Then, you start to realize that watching the clock tick can help you think through some serious issues. Then, developing a routine helps. Then getting hobbies, or working out, or joining community groups, or anything that gets your mind off of your condition. You will adjust. It just takes work."

    "Question": "Question about PTSD claim and medical retirement\n\nHey guys!\n\nI followed some advice on these forums and what do you know? I got 70% for PTSD in seven months thanks to you guys. Every one of you was more helpful than my VSO ever was. Thank you all. But now I have another battle to fight. So, I tried to get an appeal for the PTSD so that I could get 100%. However, my VSO, being the DAV, informed me that it'd take seven years. I'm not sure if that person didn't know what they were talking about or was just saying this so I would be discouraged from trying to appeal. That doesn't matter. I was then told that I could do a form and send it in to try to get medical retirement from the Army.\n\nSee, I was never med boarded. My condition was only reported to the VA for the most part. An army doctor claimed I had PTSD while I was in combat. That went a long way to helping me get my claim so quickly. So, I sent in this form in the mail. I'm not even sure what the hell it was. I was just told to do it and I could potentially get a medical retirement from the army. The notation read, \"Due to my combat related injuries I should have been medically retired.\" I was also informed that many guys don't realize that they have PTSD until after they leave service. That was my case. However, I was diagnosed with it before I left service. I just never paid any attention to it because I was trying to be a macho tough guy. Yeah, I was being dumb. I'll admit it.\n\nAnyways, I got 70% from the start. My PTSD is combat related and service connected and I always have the VA award letter. Now I sent in this form to try to get the army to give me medical retirement as well. Anyone know how all of this jazz works? I certainly don't.\n\nThanks!",
    "Response_1": "I believe an NOD is currently taking 2-3 years.  That may be a bit conservative, but it certainly isn't 7 years.  100% isn't something you try to obtain.  It is an evaluation based upon the severity of your conditions.  Does the following criteria describe you?\n\nGeneral Rating Formula for Mental Disorders: \nTotal occupational and social impairment, due to such symptoms as: gross impairment in thought processes or communication;\npersistent delusions or hallucinations; grossly inappropriate behavior; persistent danger of hurting self or others; intermittent\ninability to perform activities of daily living (including maintenance of minimal personal hygiene); disorientation to time or place;\nmemory loss for names of close relatives, own occupation, or own name .................... 100 \n\nIf not, don't clog up the system with an unsubstantiated claim. \n\nAs far as the medical retirement, I believe you are referring to a PDBR.  Does that ring a bell?  Or are you doing it thru a BCMR?",
    "Response_2": "You can, and you should, go for BOTH. They have absolutely NOTHING to do with each other, so going for one will have no effect on the other.\n\nMedical retirement is just what the name says it is.  It is retirement from the military, because of service caused medical problems that make you unfit to serve any longer.  It comes with all of the benefits of retirement from the military.  The pay is based on how long you served and what disability rating you get.\n\nUnless you got out at the end of your enlistment, you should have been Med boarded and gone before a Physical Evaluation Board.",
    "Response_3": "I've been active duty for almost 10 years been diagnosed with PTSD I was advised by my last medical advisor that I should consider medical retirement. I know nothing much about it but I would like to go that route can anyone shed a little light on this for me.",

Just want to die and need treatment but lock down will make me 100x worse and go crazy. I need some assurance before i can check in, that they wont keep me on lockdown and unable to leave.",
    "Response_1": "I can only tell you from my experience. I have been in a lockdown ward 4 times for 5-7 days. Yes you can use the phone. They treat you very well. They adjust your meds talk to lots of doctors.\n\nthen they should move you to a more comfortable ward. Listen bro I never wanted to leave when I was there because just being around all those other veterans was nice. I didn't want to go back into the real world but I new I had to. You do learn a lot there. So don't worry there not going to keep you there for ever. You will be fine.",
    "Response_2": "The inpatient treatment program I did for PTSD was not locked down. You could quit the program whenever you wanted. They had rules that were expected to follow. We were allowed to leave the ward anytime other than between midnight and 0600. We also couldn't leave the campus at all. Family was more than welcome to see you on the weekends (including young kids). We weren't allowed phones during most normal business hours, but after groups and classes it wasn't an issue. Internet access could be had at the same times phone access was. I had a great experience with the program I went to. It was great being around other vets and talking about your experiences with others who are suffering as you are. I made some great friends - friends are something that I haven't had in nearly 10 years. I also learned that the things that bothered me the most about my combat experiences were the same things that bothered others too. I also saw that my experiences and the amount of action I saw was pretty typical for others deployed the same time as me. It did a lot for me to realize I'm not such a freak after all.",
    "Response_3": "there is a big difference between being in an inpatient facility for suicide attempt or ideation than going to one for a residential PTSD program. I have been to the suicide one twice. First time I was committed the second volunteered. They only concern is to make you safe, get you stable and make a plan to help you get better. With that said you loose all freedom. From no shoe laces all the way to when you can take showers.

I dont like to think about it (although i do several times a day), and I sure as heck dont want to/like to talk about it.  It took me nearly 25 years and almost losing my marriage before I decided to finally go see some one.  Then i had to see 2 psychologists and 2 different psychiatrists, and each one wanted to hear all about the details.  I hated every moment of those meetings.  Now that i am retiring and i know i'll have to yet again re-tell them and live that all over again with someone (or more) new.  Its embarrasing, humliating, and painful.  I'd rather just stop seeing these people and just deal with it on my own again so i dont have to talk out loud about it.  eh, sorry just venting i guess....",
    "Response_1": "I've only been active in the VA mental health program for maybe 3 1/2 years, and I think I've had to get into the really traumatic details of my issues maybe two or three times. That was really only for the C&P stuff, too. I try not to bring anything bad up with the mental health people unless it's really giving me problems at home or work. There are even a few things I haven't even mentioned, because I'm scared to.",
    "Response_2": "I haven't any idea how this would be welcomed by the medical community, but maybe some time while you are strong mentally, you could type out a detailed page of the event. That way if there were more requests by mental health docs to hear the story, you could flip them a page and have them read it?",
    "Response_3": "Not bringing up the stuff that actually is behind your PTSD is kind of like going to the doctor with one foot cut off, and complaining about a blister on your finger.\n\nHow in the heck do you expect to get better, if you never address the roots of the problem?  Yes, it's hard to bring that stuff out.  BUT, like a festering tooth, things won't get better until it's out.",

So that evening, I started a chronological typed account of my experience form before the sexual assault, up until now. It took a long time to write, and ultimately ended up being fourteen pages long.  I have provided that document to my all three of my current mental health care providers.  I feel like this has helped my avoid discussing the graphic details while helping the doctors fully understand my problem.\n\nWith the exception of some EMDR sessions, the VA Doctors do not ask too much about or discuss the assault details unless, I bring it up.  To the credit of the EMDR doctor, she is very sensitive to my reaction and tolerance of  each EMDR session and asks me if I need a break from them when she recognizes the need.  \n\nIt's actually very professional, passionate and considerate healthcare.  I'd be totally screwed without it.",

I saw the Mental Health Doc at the VA annex the Max number of times i could before she had to refer me back to the main hospital. She diagnosed with Somatic symptom disorder due to a pain syndrome i have from a SC injury while i was in that ked to my medical retirement. The Pain disorder is SC as secondary to my initial injury which was a stab wound to the back of my right thigh. The injury keft me mostly oaralyzed below the knee and is the cause if my CRPS. In speaking with my PCP the other day she asked me if i had ever been evaluated for PTSD in which i answered no. she said based on my anxiety and agitation it might be related to the tramatic way in which i was injured. Sorry to be long winded but i know its tough to give advice without context My question is if i go to this evaluation and they find i do have some level of PTSD along with my Somatic pain disorder, is the VA diagnosis enough to then apply for additional disability compensation based on the VA doctors providing the diagnosis?",
    "Response_1": "It most certainly is. The VA considers secondary issues and residuals both in determining increases or rating some conditions on their own. Its not uncommon for a treating doc to pick up on things you didn't even know was wrong. My aunt is an FNP and she told me she believed I had a TBI. I thought she was full of it. Then my family started hounding me to get checked out for memory loss, compulsive behavior, speech issues and so on. Turns out my service records, and VA docs all came down to a TBI.

    "Question": "PTSD, Panic Attacks, Avoidance all while fighting for your disability benefits\n\nJust wondering how many of you deal with the fight? The VA is proposing a reduction in my PTSD benefits after a P&T eval that they initiated. I need to fight this, I want to fight this. My psychologist agrees I should retain my 100% rating. If I could do it all from the safety of my home and computer I would be okay.... but I am really struggling with all the getting out there, obtaining my records, the face-to-face or even over the phone conversations it takes to get my appeal in order. Panic sets in at just the thought of making that phone call. I try my best to just hide away in my home, talk to no-one, and see no-one outside of my children and husband. Going out in public, talking to others.... it all sets me up to let the whole world know that I'm (what I would call) my own kind-a-crazy. It's like I can hear their thoughts, their judgments against me. I do know I have a HUGE issue with avoidance, I have been told time and time again by all of my past therapists. I know that avoidance doesn't help my PTSD get better, but it sure makes my day to day a little less difficult. And all of the doctors telling me to just get out there in spite of how it makes me feel, don't have PTSD and Panic disorder and don't know what it feels like to be in public when it sets in. I'm just wondering if any of you whom understand the demons of PTSD have any tips, advice, or whatever (besides the \"just get off your butt and get it done\") as to how I could accomplish this without sending me in a downward spiral that I may not recover from.",
    "Response_1": "People who tell you to just get out there, relax, whatever, just don't have a clue.\n\nYou can't just flip a switch and turn this stuff off...what can help is daily effort to build positive momentum through small steps. Some days you'll feel like you're going backwards, particularly during the stressful claims process, but the key is to expect this and to not give up.\n\nThis, along with regular treatment and medication, can make a big difference in your quality of life.",
    "Response_2": "What exactly was said in the C&P by the Doc? Perhaps if you give some of the insight into what was said, others could chime in to give advice as to if there are grounds for a NOD. Getting a DBQ from your treating Psychologist could not hurt as well, especially if they are telling you that you are at the 100% rate currently. If the decision for reduction has not been finalized, adding this DBQ could possibly change the outcome. I also encourage you to get with your VSO, or if you do not have one, get one. This can all be done by phone. I have a VSO through the Wounded Warrior Project and he lives in Florida, so all our correspondence is through email, and phone calls. They will be helpful, but in the meantime, I do not see a need to leave the house in the short term to build an appeal. First you file a NOD, and that could take a year or more to get the SSOC back. When you get that, then you can file the appeal based on whatever you find that is not in line with the medical evidence.",
    "Response_3": "What was/were the SPECIFIC reason(s) given for decreasing your S/C rating.  We need the actual language used by the VA, if you want any advice that actually means something.\n\nYou are going to need MEDICAL evidence to counter what was said by the C&P examiner.  If you have not been getting regular treatment, you have nothing to show that you are NOT somewhat improved.\n\nI would VERY strongly recommend that you get a Veterans Service Officer (VSO) involved with your claim.",
    "Response_4": "It will not magically get better from people telling you to \"get out there\" or hounding you. I do understand there's no light switch. People tend to think that just getting out there can somehow cure or negate the effects of ptsd. It does help some people and others it causes more harm than good.\n\nI believe we all have a goal of gaining a sense of normality. I certainly hope the OP and others find theirs. I Definately know the feeling of trying to pick up diapers from Wal-Mart and going full blown panic and hyper militant. Its hard, and it sucks. My advice is to get through your process, and of you suffer from avoidance, then try to do your tasks in a way that can minimize discomfort. I had to do a number of things I didn't want to in order to complete my processes. I won't lie and say, \"Oh it was easy.\" It wasn't. But it's important to get things done, so you can take care of yourself. You can also do a POA so some things can be done for you. My wife did a number of my documents collection, etc... \n\nBut I do sincerely hope you get taken care of. I also hope that someday \"getting out there\" becomes easier for US.",
    "Response_5": "I wish I had positive information to add, but all I can say is WOW! I have been feeling like that and worse over the years and just thought that I am completely effed up and this I experience singularly... I was wrong again. Its strange...to know I am having these issues in common is somewhat not comforting, but made me realize that I have real issues. My C&Ps stated that I have total occupational and social Impairment. I was in denial when I read that...not so much anymore. I have posted an excerpt from my C&P and have yet to receive a response. Reading the above comments has settled me down a bit. For now."

    "Question": "PTSD criterion & murders at camp books, vietnam 1970\n\nI was stationed at FLC, Camp Books, Da Nang, Vietnam on February 5th, 1970 when the Maintenance Battalion club was fragged by black Marines in a racially motivatged terrorist type attack where one Cpl was killed and over 60 other Marines and military personell were wounded.  The VA filed a claim on my behalf claming PTSD and I was awarded a 50% disability.  One of the stressors I listed was this incident at the Maintenance Battalion Club and the resulting racial tensions that followed.  This portion of my claim was turned down by the Dr.(??) who did my evaluation because he said it didn't meet the criteria.  I was working base security during this incident and responded to the explosion, attempted to help where I could and provide what security could be maintained within the first minutes after the murder and attempted murders of so many.  For this incident to be denied as a stressor in and of itself is undefencible and the racial incidents that occured afterwards not to be considered...I can't understand. \n\nHas anyone who was there that night experienced anything similar?",
    "Response_1": "Your stressor/stressors indicate you have PTSD. On the percentage criteria do you think you fall closer to 70 or 100%. Have you looked at those criteria ratings? They have accepted your stressors. What impact has PTSD had on your life? That is where ratings are measured.",
    "Response_2": "If you think you should get a higher rating than 50%, the specific stressor \"event\" doesn't matter of you already have service connection. The bigger consideration, is how it is a problem in your everyday life. If you look at the rating schedule and feel symptoms better reflect 70+% then you can ask for an increase on the impacts alone.",
    "Response_3": "It would be VERY wrong for any therapist (Psychiatrist, Psychologist, etc.) to tell you that a stressor like this \"did not meet the criteria\" for PTSD. In fact, I would go so far as to say that it would be a form of Malpractice to tell a patient something like that.\n\nAn event such as that could easily mark anyone. I sincerely hope that you are getting treatment, and that you discuss this event, along with any others that contribute to your PTSD, with your treating folks.",
    "Response_4": "I'm willing to get the C&P examiner was an outside contractor. They sometimes try too hard to read between the lines of the rating standards, and often over analyze the meaning of the criteria. \n\nI would follow the advice of The Old Medic, and actively discuss these events in therapy. These traumatic events, I'm sure are a hurdle for you. Again if you file for an increase, the stressor matters lesIs than how PTSD impacts your life. But treatment wise, the stressor matters big time. I hope you find peace. God Bless.",

    "Response_3": "That Has inspired me to try and do the same.\n\nEven a few steps of success makes you realize you can make progress even if you have failed several times before.\n\nI tried several times with smoking and have finally stopped for 10 years.

    "Question": "Ambien - Good or Bad????\n\nHello Everyone!  Happy Monday!\n\nI have a question - my boyfriend had his VA mental health appointment last week and the doctor put him on Ambien.  Do any of you use this?  I have noticed a nice change over the weekend.  He is sleeping better as well and is able to keep his CPAP mask on all night.\n\nAlso he is scheduled for acupuncture eval today at the VA.  They say this helps too.  Anyone doing this?\n\n\nThanks!",
    "Response_1": "Ambien is a good drug for many but everyone is different. It does not work for all. It does not work for me. It seems to work well for your boyfriend so good for him. A good night's sleep can change your whole outlook and disposition.",
    "Response_2": "YOU need to understand that there is no \"Cure\" for PTSD. The only way it can be \"cured\" is if the person suffers brain damage to the point that those memories no longer exist. And if that were to happen, they would be virtually dead.\n\nTreatment DOES help the person learn to live with their PTSD better. If a person stays in treatment, they may be able to live a pretty normal life. It sure as hell bets living with the anger, fear, suspicion, etc. that can go with PTSD.\n\nAmbien is NOT addictive. It, along with many other medications, is used to treat a variety of mental health conditions. Since each persons body chemistry is different, they may require 1-2-3 or more medications to get the best results. It is also not uncommon for a person to have to try many different medications, until they find the one (or the combination) that works best for them.\n\nThe single most important thing is for your boyfriend to STAY IN TREATMENT. You are doing the right thing to encourage him to do so.",
    "Response_3": "AKA Zolpidem Tartrate, Ambien is one of my drugs provided through VA. I have had to sign a VA document noting that I recognize this Rx is a controlled substance. I was told this Rx would aid me in getting to sleep but it was not designed to keep me asleep. My dose is 10mg and that 10mg is broken into five doses by me. It works but it worries me to use it. I would have a full conversation with your PCP about this Rx. Peace",
    "Response_4": "I was on ambien for about 5 years along with trazadone. It works. Only issue I had was after about 4 years...I had word recall problems. Trying to say something but could not find the words to say.\nOff of ambein now...and don't have the recall issue anymore.",
    "Response_5": "I just wanted to sound off on this topic. Ambien is a very good medication. But to say definitively that its non-addictive...that 100% bullshit! And I quote from health.com...\n\"...is this sleeping pill addictive? Experts say no�not if it's USED AS DIRECTED. However, people who take Ambien at higher-than-recommended doses or for long periods of time may be unaware that they are boosting its addictive potential.\" My mom zoned out on Ambien 6 years ago. I did the same in 2010. Use with drug caution and have someone monitor the usage.  As a PTSD sufferer myself, I know that I will do whatever it takes to clear my mind of the bad memories. That's why my wife has been designated as my caregiver. I need help managing my meds. Don't just say...\"Yay...it's safe!\" Watch that veteran...monitor those meds. Otherwise, be prepared to send them to rehab or clean up after a suicide."

    "Question": "C&P schedule now I am very nervous\n\nI filed for TDIU in August after being disability retired for PTSD from my federal job and also had a NOD pending for two years now for my 50% PTSD rating (70% overall). I just got an envelop from FedEx and I am scheduled for a C&P with a contract Psychologist in Orlando! I don't know if this is for my appeal or for my IU claim but I am very nervous. I don't like to talk to new people about my issues. I barely talked and had a really hard time during my initial C&P.\n\nDo any of you have any pointers? I was going to make a list of my issues and take it with me because when I get stressed my mind goes blank and I bottle up and I really want to make the most out of this!\n\nMy VSO at the VA had recently told me they were not considering my PTSD for IU because I had a NOD pending. Which was confusing and the first time I ever heard of this. It's my main issue and why I filed for the IU. I had been on FMLA for three years before I finally put in my retirement application from my civil service and they approved my within 3 months and it even states in my letter due to PTSD. Got I am a nervous wreck....",
    "Response_1": "You NEED to discuss your issues with that Psychologist. How can they assess just how your PTSD is affecting you, unless YOU let them know?\n\nIf you are so uncomfortable talking about it that you simply can't, you REALLY NEED TO BE IN MUCH MORE CONCENTRATED TREATMENT.\n\nIf necessary, write down how your PTSD affects you. Describe what you do daily. Talk about what you can not do. Mention your personal hygiene, and whether or not you have problems keeping it up. Do you change clothing regularly? Do you cook for yourself? Do you go shopping, and if you do, when, how and where. If you have a spouse that helps you with those kinds of things, mention that.\n\nTalk about your fears, or anything else that helps clouds your ability to function.\n\nIt is essential that you tell the truth, AND THE WHOLE TRUTH, about what your life is like. You do not want to exaggerate anything, but you also do not want to play problems down. You need to lay everything out, exactly as it affects you day to day, hour to hour, etc.\n\nYour NOD will be dealt with first. You may get a significantly higher rating than you currently have. Once that determination is made, then they will deal with the issue of IU.\n\nMake certain that the VA has a copy of your disability retirement paperwork. You may also want to file for Social Security Disability Insurance, if you are still insured with them.\n\nKeep in mind that this psychologist is not there to do anything but assess just how disabled you are. They have no other agenda. So, this is YOUR chance to give them the input they need to make a valid determination.",
    "Response_2": "I found this out the hard way as well.  Apparently, you can not have an appeal and a request for increase processing at the same time for the same ailment.  You have two choices, either let the appeal go through, or cancel the appeal and allow the TDIU claim to go through.  I chose to cancel the appeal in my case, as my TDIU was filed within one year of my original award letter where I was rated at 70% for PTSD.  So, my claim will go back to my original award date if the evidence shows that I was unemployable from that time forward. \n\nIn fact, the line of questioning went back to my exit from the Army during my C&P that I just had last November.  The Doc was good at taking down dates, and recording them on the exam notes.  It is your story, so there is no need to be nervous about the process.  You know when the symptoms made you unable to work.  Tell it like it is. \n\nIn your case, cancelling that appeal may be too risky unless you have strong medical evidence to support your current TDIU request, and in doing so, you would lose out on any backpay you might get if you win the appeal.  The C&P is important to the process, but the rater will take all evidence into consideration, so if your medical records paint one picture, the C&P should support what is being reported by your medical records.  In the end it is your call, which is what my VSO told me.  I had a favorable C&P, so my VSO advised me to cancel my appeal, which I did.  \n\nGood luck.

    "Question": "Why do psychiatrist not tell the truth to their patients?\n\nMy husband is rated 70% for PTSD. He went in to see his psychiatris last week. He is seen every 3  months. He has been taking Ambien for sleep, but in the last couple of months it hasn't been working. He has been on it for about 5 years.\n\nWhen he went into the appointment he told the doctor about his sleeping problems. The doctor looked at his file / computer and said oh you're on codein, which my husband said yes. Its number 3 codeine. The doctor said since you were on codeine I can't help you with any sleeping drugs. My husband was stunned and asked what he was supposed to do for sleep. The doctor said there was nothing he could do. He came and told me what had happened. I waited a few days so I could see the news in my health e vet and it said everything was fine with the veteran and that the veteran had asked to be taken off ambien. I secured message the doctor and basically caught him in a lie. He didn't know what to say when he replied. He called me at home that evening and said that VA let's cracking down on narcotics. So I asked him what is the veterans supposed to do. Sleep or be in pain. I asked him if he told all of the veterans this or was a was a flyer sent out or what. I also told him that they were going to be a lot of very upset veterans when they find this out. My husband said it was never told to him or get a flyer or anything. This doctor was quite still nervous I wanted to make an appointment for my husban and need to come along and explain it to us. As I said he told me the doctor said that his hands were tied. No help available. Veterans had a choice sleeping or pain.\n\nAfter the phone call the next morning I checked my healthy vet and the wording was just changed around. Nothing about not be able to sleep or anything. Why can't they just be just honest? All they do exchange the notes and life is good for the veteran.\n\nOne more thing. My husband also asked for counseling. He wasgiven  an appointment once every 5 weeks with a social worker. Sorry to go on but this really has me upset. If anyone has the same type of experience please let me know. I know you guys tell the truth!\n\nWe moved from one state to another. The other VA where we used to live was outstanding.\nThank you",
    "Response_1": "Your post sounds as if you call into the doc was confrontational at the start. I'd probably suggest coming in for an in-person meeting as phone calls aren't the best means of communication for some people/situations. \n\nCurious if that \"lie\" was a mistake by the doc, misunderstanding by your husband and then communicated to you, or any other possibility. To what advantage is it for a doctor to lie about the combination of narcotics and sleeping aids?",
    "Response_2": "I do what I can. It helps me fall asleep.  Is the Prazozin prescription the correct dosage.  Some folks need 6-8 a night for it to help them.  Otherwise, Sounds like your husband should spend more time at the VA seeking help.  I've been going there for ten years and it has helped in a number of ways.  Mostly in recognizing triggers and fighting them off.  I have a natural service dog and find that he is there when I need him.   I am 100% T&P and go to the VA for group twice a week, one on one counseling every two weeks with a psychologist, and see my Psychiatrist every three months.  I don't sleep well at all, but catch up sometimes. bad nightmares, then end up laying in bed unable to motivate.  I'll ask about Ambien this week. Just to see what they say.  I know for a fact that they are cracking down on addictive pain killers.  They just prescribed some to me for the first time....haven't cracked the bottle.  Don't want the addiction.",
    "Response_3": "Print records when you see an error. Some patient advocates can do some things if they choose. Up to and including getting a Doc fired. I find diazepam gets me to sleep but not stay asleep. About a year ago my Psychiatrist cut that from 50 mg to 20 mg a day, really ticked me off. Eventually the doc got caught in a lie. I believe he's been sued a couple times. Trazadone helps to keep me asleep but I'm doped when I get up. Hope some of this helps.",
    "Response_4": "I posted something about this a few months back. My Psychologist gave me the heads up that she was starting to receive memos from the higher ups. I received a letter in the mail about having to \"cut back\" on one or both. They are \"concerned\" about that fact that the benzos and narcos combined ,do damage to the patient. They are supposed to \"ween me down\" but I bet it'll be a complete drop of one, if not both.\nI am 66 yrs. old--- leave me the f*** alone! ( I can hear a certain reply coming already)",
    "Response_5": "I take 200mg of Trazodone every night, and have done so for years. I do NOT wake up feeling drunk, wasted, or in any way unable to function. I CAN \"shit/shower/shave/dress\" in 15 minutes if I need to (and I do that one morning each week, when I have a 6:00 a.m. breakfast with a bunch of friends).\n\nHow a medication affects YOU, has absolutely nothing to do with how it affects another person. Your body chemistry, and you ability to process medications is unique to YOU.\n\nInstead of telling someone NOT to use a particular medication, tell them to communicate very clearly with their treating people about how any medication, or combination of medications, is affecting them. Way too many people don't get the desired effects from medications, but don't bother to tell their doctors what is going on. You need to COMMUNICATE, with anyone that is prescribing medications for you, about how you are reacting to the medication(s).\n\nYOU are in charge of YOU! You have to be proactive and speak up for yourself. Doctors are NOT mind readers (Thank God), and if you do not tell them, they will assume that the medication(s) are having the desired effects on you."

Is there another C&P Exam during the appeal? What is the appeal process? Thanks for any advice or information.",
    "Response_1": "You may get another C&P exam, or you may not.\n\nIf you are NOT getting treatment, it would help you, and probably your appeal, to get help with your PTSD. Nothing beats treatment records at showing how you are doing.",
    "Response_2": "I was also awarded 50% and put in an appeal for 70%. I got another C&P but it wasn't a \"replacement\" C&P, it was more of an update. The examiner asked about everything SINCE the last exam, which I thought was kind of silly. I felt it would have been better to explain why the last exam missed some things rather than give an update. Anyway, I'm not a lawyer, but a lawyer or VSO might be able to help you in this matter. Wish you good luck & good health.",
    "Response_3": "There is a difference between an NOD (notice of disagreement) and an appeal.\n\nUsually a 2nd exam is required and they will want to know what has changed and/or what has gotten worse.\n\nThese are things that are usually marked in the 70% category, but the entire record is looked at. If any of these apply to you I would recommend bringing in the documentation to support them.\n\nNeglect of veteran�s appearance and hygiene\n\nSpatial disorientation: veteran typically has severe dementia.\n\nImpaired impulse control, such as unprovoked irritability with periods of violence: this veteran is a �loose cannon� and gets in recurrent physical fights; veteran may have spending sprees or gambling problems that get them in debt or significant financial trouble; veteran�s recklessness and impulsive behaviors leads to legal ramifications or negative life consequences (i.e., divorce). \n\nInability to establish and maintain effective relationships: veteran has been isolated throughout most of adult life; veteran has no close relationships or a few superficial relationships; veteran repels people due to his severe anger, suspiciousness, or impulsivity. \n\nDifficulty in adapting to stressful circumstances, including work or a work-like setting: veteran has difficulty maintaining stable jobs due to mental health condition; veteran may experience serial firings or may repeatedly quit jobs, usually due to conflict at work, paranoia, boredom.\n\nObsessional rituals which interfere with routine activities:  the veteran�s obsessional/compulsive symptoms are so severe as to warrant a formal diagnosis of OCD\n\nNear-continuous panic or depression affecting the ability to function independently, appropriately and effectively: A veteran has a vegetative type depression. They spend a lot of their day in bed and their ability to carry out ADLs would have to be compromised.",

    "Question": "Somebody Please Ease My Paranoia\n\nI have a rating of 70% for PTSD as well as a few rated at 10-20%, and an overall rating of 80% currently.  I appealed my PTSD rating last year, and a few months afterwards, I requested an increase. This was directly after having a mental health breakdown while at work.  I have been receiving treatment and had my C&P for PTSD last November.  The C&P was favorable for the 100% rate.  Soon afterwards, I cancelled my appeal so that my claim for increase and TDIU could get rated. Whoever was working my claim requested an Independent Medical Opinion for the C&P that I had in November.  Now, I know that the VHA is supposed to be separate from the VBA in terms of one being a decision maker for disability compensation, and the other being focused on patient care, but after reading over what was requested in my VA records, the fact that they mention my appeal is alarming.  Why tell the C&P Doctor that I have an open appeal?  I have paranoia and this along with more instances have me not trusting the folks that are supposed to be treating me, making my recovery harder. \nHere is what was requested as is written in my VA records.\nAfter review of the VA examination dated November 5, 2015 and VA treatment records please state if the Veteran's new diagnosis of bipolar I disorder is a progression of the prior diagnosis of PTSD, correction of an error in the prior diagnosis, or development of a new and separate condition. If you are unable to provide this please state so with complete rational. Please note that the evaluation of PTSD is currently on appeal. \nBeyond that, the last meeting I had with my Psychologist, I informed her how I feel that my symptoms are not fully being noted in my file.  I first began noticing this as soon as both my med Doctor and my Psychologist got wind that I had a C&P exam for PTSD increase.  Almost like they started showing a perpetual increase in functionality within my notes starting once they found out I was requesting an increase.  I tested this out at the last meeting.  I battle suicidal thoughts, and have expressed these thoughts to the Doctors on multiple occaisons, and not once in my entire medical record, even when I first represented for treatment, have those thoughts ever been recorded by either of them.  They are recorded on both my C&P's as well as in my medical records from the Army though. I told my Doctor how I had thought about suicide the entire day the Sunday before my appointment, which was true. Everyday is a battle, as I am sure most of you can relate to. When I go to read what she noted in my records, I see this written:\nNo evidence of suicidality (ideation, plan, or intent) or increase in suicide risk factors during the session that warranted explicit suicide risk assessment. No evidence of dangerousness to others (ideation, plan, or intent) or increase in risk factors that warranted explicit violence risk assessment. \nSo, noticing how they have been acting since that C&P, I have begun to get more and more suspicious of who they are really working for.  Are they there to treat me, or save the government money?  I feel as if the notes from my treatment are painting the picture that I am getting better, but I know that I have declined in the past few months.  My isolation has increased, and I am more paranoid as ever. Is this just the policy of the VHA not to mention suicidal ideation in treatment notes?  Should I request a new team of Doctors?  Really, I am just waiting to receive my compensation so that I can purchase private healthcare as I see the services offered by the VA as substandard in many regards.  For one, the conflicting priorities I feel I have outlined here. \nAnyone know why a Rater or VSR would inform a C&P Doctor of a pending appeal?  I can not think of one reason that these two seperate agencies would need to exchange that type of information, and the inference that one can reach when pondering why that would be added to the request is troubling.  It gives the impression that there would be a different way of handling an appeal versus a standard claim, which should not happen at the VHA level as VBA and VHA have different organizational objectives.  Thanks in advance.  \nBTW... The IMO was favorable, service connecting me with both PTSD and Bipolar Disorder with \"at least as likely as not to have occured in service\". \nHere is what was opined:\na. The condition claimed was at least as likely as not (50% or greater probability) incurred in or caused by the claimed in-service injury, event or illness.\nc. Rationale: The veteran's new diagnosis of bipolar disorder represents diagnostic clarification and progression of the condition diagnosed as PTSD during his military service. The PTSD diagnosis remains valid, meaning that the two diagnoses, PTSD and bipolar disorder, coexist, are comorbid and at least as likely as not are related to the veteran's active duty military service.",
    "Response_1": "The exam is favorable and addresses your old and new conditions and determines that they are co-morbid and not separate issues.  No worries there (IMHO)\n\\\nHowever, just my view here, but starting a claim or appeal, then withdrawing, asking for one thing, then another, etc. probably isn't a favorable sign for you!  If you are that savvy and capable of initiating, modifying and withdrawing things, maybe someone will determine that you are not really,occupationally disabled....jus6tsomething to consider (and remember, raters have some discretion in decisions!)",
    "Response_2": "About all I can say is that you are reading a lot into what has happened that is more paranoia than reality. Nothing that the rater did is out of line. Their job is to provide the examiner with as much information as possible and their is no conspiracy afoot to keep you from getting anything that you are entitled to receive nor is anyone trying to save the government money. After 30 years at VBA I can assure you that saving government money is probably the last thing that rank and file employees are thinking about. They are probably much more concerned with what the cafeteria is serving for lunch. Although not what you asked, based on my degrees in both Social Work and Psychology and a brief career as a Social Worker during which I attained just enough knowledge to be dangerous, everything you have described about your condition sure sounds more like bipolar disorder than it does PTSD to me.",
    "Response_3": "The rater simply provided the C&P Examiner with the truth.\n\nAs to your treating Psychologist, she wrote down the literal truth. There had been no change in your suicidal ideation, you were not thinking of suicide right then, and she did not believe that you were in any danger of acting on such thoughts. Therefore, she did not need to do a risk assessment concerning the probability f your acting on your suicidal thoughts. \n\nThe result of the C&P exam was favorable to you. \"At least as likely as not\" is a win for you. So, your Bi-Polar Disorder is pretty likely to be found to be Service Connected.\n\nNO, you do not need a new set of doctors. You DO NEED TO COMMUNICATE WITH THEM ABOUT YOUR PARANOIA! You need to discuss your interpretation of what you are reading with your treating folks.\n\nIf I were treating you, because of your paranoia, I would likely make your treatment notes confidential, and not open to you. Your paranoia makes you see things that are not there, and reading your treatment notes is interfering with your treatment.",
    "Response_4": "The next app't you have with a Psychologist, go nose to nose with them. Don't let them change the subject and be relentless until an acceptable answer is received. I feel for you Bro!! \nMight even take in a typed out explaination (and a copy for you to follow and keep) of what you were planning to cover with them and have them sign it (which I doubt that they would) but then there is another topic you could cover with them - if they won't sign it--Why???\nYou should be pretty much in charge of your appt's with them - as to what you talk about. Sounds like you will have to force it from them somehow.",
    "Response_5": "You can, and you ARE, reading into her notes what you WANT AND EXPECT TO SEE.\n\nThe fact that you spent 2 days in the basement may very well be less time than you have done this in the past. \n\nIt would be VERY unusual for a Manic State to cause paranoia. Quite the opposite is normally the case, the person feels on top of the world and like they can do anything. Nobody and nothing could stop them from doing whatever pops into their mind.\n\nYou can argue to the end of days about what YOU perceive those notes to mean. You believe what YOU choose to believe, and nobody is going to shake you from that belief pattern.\n\nI suspect that you know full well that this is your mental illness manifesting itself. But, since you know more that your therapist, or anyone else, you continue to believe the worst.\n\nYou do not want anyone here to \"help\" you. You actually want people here to agree with your viewpoint. Unfortunately, that is not going to happen, because your \"viewpoint\" just shows your mental illness in action.\n\nI would suspect that you need to either be put on medication(s), or that your medications be adjusted to meet your real needs."

    "Question": "PTSD and Shoplifting\n\nLook I know it's wrong, but I think there's a correlation between my PTSD and shoplifting. And it's not an excuse to do so. I've been busted twice and continue to do it. Psychologically there has to be some connection. I, even ok with going to jail. I am 100% PTSD. I WANT TO STOP. What is going on with me and why? It makes me feel good. All the medicine they've prescribed me helps to an extent. But stealing is satisfying. I hope nobody thinks I'm the devil, maybe I am. This is my favorite sin. Vets helping a vet is what I'm looking for.",
    "Response_1": "There are some great people here with actuall background and training to help give you a better response however I will do my best. No, I dont think your the devil I think if it wasnt shoplifting it would be something else. I think taking the time to understand it then making little changes to help stop it. I am trying a comfort thing for when I want a drink and I am carrying something in my pocket from my kids when I even so much as think about a drink I just reach for that to remind me why NOT to.",
    "Response_2": "If you keep this up, YOU WILL BE BUSTED AND YOUR KID WILL KNOW! So will your family, friends and a whole lot of other people.\n\nNo, this is NOT uncontrollable. That's just an excuse for doing this. You may very well have a desire to be punished, and this is your way of trying to get that punishment.\n\nYou need to be in treatment, NOW. You need to be totally honest with your treating person(s) about this, and tell them exactly what you are doing.\n\nAnd, you need to stay out of stores until you have a handle on this. PTSD will NOT excuse you if you get arrested, and you are taking a chance on having a permanent record as a thief.\n\nGet your butt to your VAMC or Clinic, and start dealing with this NOW.",
    "Response_3": "It's refreshing to see someone come out and be honest about their situation. Are you in treatment? If not it might be positive to get in treatment and get your situation sorted out. If you continue on your current trajectory I think you will hit a wall sooner or later. I do wish you good luck in the future.",
    "Response_4": "The discussions I have had with my psychologist have educated me over how much we really don't know about the brain.  For instance, I served almost 12 years without any problems, and not until a deployment in 2011-12, did I come back with symptoms associated with PTSD.  I had never sought out any mental health, and was a good Soldier. However, once I started showing symptoms and was diagnosed with PTSD, it was not even a year later that I began to develop bipolar symptoms as well. I have asked how one can contract bipolar at the age of 35?  Bipolar is rarely diagnosed this late in life. The answer I get is that really, no one knows.  The mind, once broken, can manifest all sorts of follow-on problems that perhaps you were predisposed too.  Good luck.",

    "Question": "PTSD with Panic Attacks (provisional)\n\nMy step daughter served in the Navy on a Destroyer over in the Middle East....she was seen not long ago by a Psychiatrist who put several things in her notes, including PTSD with panic attacks (provisional).  Any clue as to what this means? Like she has PTSD with panic attacks for the time being but could get better....does this make sense? Thanks",
    "Response_1": "Provisional means that the doc is leaning toward that diagnosis, but does not have enough data yet to flat out diagnose it.\n\nYour daughter would be a lot better off coming to the forums herself, and asking her own questions. We don't bite (well most of us don't).",
    "Response_2": "It sounds like she was an \"HM\" Hospital Corpsman. Believe it or not Corpsmen experience some overwhelming situations even at sea.

    "Question": "Already had an MH C&P, do I need one for PTSD too?\n\nHi guys,\nMy claim has been very complex and has been in the systems for a long time. Long story short I was diagnosed by my private provider with severe Generalized Anxiety Disorder, back in January I was called by the SRVSR on my claim. She told me my issues seem to fall in line with PTSD and has anyone said that before, I told her yes they have and explained a little about the things that have happened. She said I should submit a PTSD claim and explain what happened (I also have verifiable proof as well). Now would I need to have another C&P for PTSD? I check eBennies and they requested an examination today Feb 8th, but the due date is the 17th which I find rather quick. Do they send the examiner your medical file, your PTSD statement, and the DBQ from the MH C&P for an opinion?",
    "Response_1": "PTSD is the only mental problem that MUST be diagnosed by a VA Psychiatrist or doctoral level Clinical Psychologist. That person must either be on staff, or a contractor with the VA. So yes, at a minimum you would need to have a C&P exam done through the VA.\n\nThe VA will provide the C&P examiner with all of the necessary records.",
    "Response_2": "Yes, you'd need another C&P for a PTSD claim. The examiner should have all the relevant records.\n\nGood luck!",

    "Question": "Good Days vs Bad Days (Before and During treatment) observation\nGood morning everyone,\n\nI am a man and prior to getting treatment for being raped by two men while serving in West Germany in 1985, my life was a bit of a mess afterwards for sure.  The usual stuff, constantly seeing doctors for headaches, anxiety, panic attacks, nightmares, sleeplessness ect....  Over the course of my adult life, my good days were pretty good while my bad days were pretty bad.  Not a real huge swing between good and bad.  \n\nNearly three years ago, I experienced what is being referred to by my VA psychiatrist as a \"stressor event\" at a dental office (I think that's what she called it).   This set me off into a extreme and more frequent cycle of emotional distress between good and bad days, with the good days being pretty good and the bad days extreme and literally unfathomable.  I lived or tried to live with it by \"soldiering thru it\", not telling a soul until mid November 2015 when I finally wrote my primary care doctor a letter explaining my problem.  BTW, that was the best decision of my life and my VA doctor \n\nAnyway, after a few months of therapy, medication and EMDR, and of course unemployment, I have noticed that my good days are a bit better than they used to be.  I actually laugh out loud a few times per week and feel pretty decent.  However, my bad days seem to remain terrible or may have even gotten worse.  I am frightened by loud noises, crowds of people. people watching and following me, looking at myself in the mirror, seeing men that resemble the ones that raped me (that is any man with short hair).  I also struggle to leave the house.  Strangely, I feel very comfortable sitting in the waiting room of the local VA clinic.  If I start to panic while driving to and from someplace in town, and the clinic is nearby, I will drive to the clinic and run inside real quick and sit down.  Visiting with the other VA service members and seeing the VA police presence makes me feel good and less stressed out.  After a while, my wife will text or call me and asks me if I'm OK.  If I am not feeling comfortable driving, she will then bring my daughter down to the clinic to pick me up.  It's embarrassing for me, but I can't help it.  I have the best family in the world.\n\n#1) So, I was wondering of anyone here suffering from PTSD or (MST) has experienced this cyclic change that I have?  \n#2) If so, how do you manage each cycle (the good and bad parts)?\nMy goal of course, is to gradually fill my life with so many good cycles, that there is no room for bad cycles.  It is a work in progress for sure..\n\n\nLastly, I have noticed a change in my behavior towards my dog \"Buddy\".  He is a Vizla and we have had him for years.  Me and Buddy have always had a great bond and he is a great dog.. you know,  mans best friend.  Since starting therapy, I have really become more attached to him and often hold him tightly and close my eyes while hugging him.  I frequently tell him out loud, that I love him, which is something I did not do before.   Being a good dog, he allows me to do this and smiles back at me.  I am so lucky\n\nThanks for listening everyone, I am having a good moment and just needed to talk.  I wish we could all meet sometime and have some pizza or something.",
    "Response_1": "PM\nWell, I can tell you that having combat PTSD myself as well as a bipolar diagnosis, I too have good days (sort of) and bad days, and everyday is a struggle.  It is like there is a fight constantly in my head.  It can be totally silent around me, but my mind does not shut down with the chatter.  It is my chatter if you were wondering, but nonetheless, chatter.  I search through events surrounding my stressor, which was a decision I made in combat that resulted in 6 of my guys becoming casualties.  I have a hard time moving forward.  It forever changed me as a person, and killed the person I might have been had I chosen the correct path where none of them would have been placed in that dangerous spot.  We all have our demons.  What is worse is that I find myself reliving any and all interactions I have these days to the extent where I pick apart what I said, what I did, in an endless effort to identify if I acted \"crazy\".  Most of the tiime, I see it as crazy which is a contributing reason to my constant isolation.  \n\nI am starting EMDR therapy in a couple of weeks.  Really, I am not looking forward to it, but I want to get better and that is all the VA is offering at the moment.  I guess, talking about the event to another soul would allow me to take some of the weight off my shoulders.  Every situation is unique, and mine goes much deeper as I was forced out of the service following that combat tour due to the downsizing.  Like getting kicked in the nuts twice in a short period of time.  I just wish I would have sought out treatment sooner.  My stubbornness kept me from seeing how messed up I really was.  No amount of insight from others was enough to enable me to see the entire picture.  \n\nI went through jobs like they were going out of style in my short two years of being out of the service. I did not seek out treatment until I found myself in a manic state one day, while at work. I had no idea that I was bipolar at the time, thinking that PTSD was all I had. Pretty much a nurvous breakdown ensued, and I ended up quitting and walking out. For some reason, I had convinced myself that my employer was attempting to take away my rights.  Anger was the order of the day, and I was faced with a choice.... get into treatment now, or end up on the nightly news. I immediately went to the VA clinic and was seen, and the battle began.  \n\nSince I started treatement, I have done medication therapy, and am seen every couple of weeks by both a med doc and a therapist.  I was already pretty bad at the time, and had been living in a psychosis where I thought the world was going to end for a year at this point.  It was not until the meds pulled me out of it, that I was able to identify the false reality I was living in.  My mind had built layers, upon layers of delusions.  I am still working through my interactions during that crazy time.  I said a lot of things, did a lot of things, and now I face them individually when it is silent and my mind works through them.  \n\nEveryday is a struggle.  Everyday is a new fight.  All we can do is attempt to move forward.  There has got to be light at the end of this tunnel.",
    "Response_2": "Buddy is a great name for your friend, Mine is \"annie\". The minute I walk into the kitchen from either the basement or from outside, she will be there. At that point she will either greet me or retreat and avoid me. She knows my state of mind.\nFrom her safe place, she will study me when I sit down in my chair. And at a certain point in time, after her evaluation is confirmed, she will go to her bin of toys and carefully pick out the appropriate one to come and give me. I have watched her at times for 10 minutes, searching for that right one. At times, it is nothing but a skeleton of a toy that she gutted long ago but it is always the appropriate one for the time.\nEvery night she sleeps next to me on the couch. On the worse nights, she will lay across my chest. Even tho it hurts me more when I am in physical pain (she is a beagle--wieghs 48 lbs), I wouldn't ask her to move, for the world. She is my best friend and I am sure that Buddy will be/ is yours also. Irreplaceable!!!!!",
    "Response_3": "Every person experiences PTSD in their own unique way. While the names of things may be the same, nobody else feels depression exactly the same way that you do; nobody experiences the \"good days\" exactly the same way that you do.\n\nHaving a fairly regular cycle of good and bad days may indicate that you have something else going on, in addition to your PTSD. That is more commonly a feature of Bi-Polar Disorder (what used to be called Manic-Depressive disorder). It is not at all uncommon for people with PTSD to develop Bi-Polar.\n\nYou are doing exactly the right thing in getting appropriate treatment. One thing that MIGHT help your treatment team is to keep a diary or journal, outlining each day's good or bad features. This would give them a good idea of the kinds of cycles you are going through.\n\nMST is horrible for anyone. It is especially hard on many men, because it calls into question their idea of \"manhood\". This is especially true of GI's. They simply try to \"Suck it up\", and as you put it, \"Soldier On\". The bad part of that is that their brain continues to try to deal with the trauma, and over time, the problem gets worse and worse.\n\nMale on male MST is far more common than most people would think. It is a means of domination, of \"getting\" someone that is a bit \"different\", etc. I have seem many cases during my time on active duty where the troops were suspicious of anyone that read a lot, that didn't drink a lot when off duty, that was shy, that had different hobbies than most of the guys, etc., etc. All too often, they were suspected of being Gay, or of being someone that simply didn't \"fit in\" to the expectations of some of the more Neanderthal types.\n\nYou are doing EXACTLY the right thing by getting treatment. This was NOT your fault, this was a horrible assault on YOU. You DESERVE the best treatment you can get, and you DESERVE to have a happy life.\n\nAs to your dog, well dogs are accepting of you no matter what. They listen well, never criticize you, are faithful and loyal, respond very well to affection, and they don't give a damn if you are upset, crying, happy or anything else. They never judge you because of something that happened to you. Vizla's are wonderful dogs (I had one for 15 years), and they are great at \"therapy\". So, what you are experiencing with Buddy is a VERY good thing.\n\nKeep going to therapy, and try to make those \"good days\" even better. Take Buddy for a long walk when you feel down (it helps, believe me), or play with him.\n\nAnd please, come back here and keep us posted on how you are doing. We DO understand.",
    "Response_4": "The VA knows that MST is often not reported in service, for obvious reasons, and they have special, non-traditional standards for such claims as a result.

    "Question": "PTSD and Depression\n\nI hope I am not posting too much but I find that I come here to read up and learn more. It seems like since I have been dealing with treatment and trying to get better I have also been dealing with depression. I have been reading here specifically in this forum and now see a lot of other people here do the same things I do. I strugle to find the will to leave the house often finding reasons to stay home when my wife has to go somewhere. I know my personal hygene has suffered as I loose interest due to a sense of hopelessness after losing my job. My wife and kids are my only support system but its obvious to my kids I am sad some days as my son will come up to me and say \"dad, you look sad\" ?I used to drink tequilla and whiskey but havent had a drop in months (I would like to go get a bottle but I know thats going down the wrong road.) My wife likes wine so I found myself drinking her wine in excess. I approached my wife a few days ago and told her me switching from the hard stuff to wine is no better so I will no longer be drinking anything, I went on to tell her until I start to feel better about myself and things improve its not a good idea for me to drink at all. I have since switched from wine at night to decaf herbal tea. I told my wife I can see where this would go if I continued down this road...I dont want to loose my family, she is 100% supportive. I am not asking her to not have any wine in the house I just wanted her to know that it wont be something I will be doing anymore since one glass turns into two then three and so on.I am awaiting my IU claim and am hopefull to be on a road of recovery however I fear it will be a long one with many little steps towards success.",

I wish I could stop but I have not found the courage and fortitude to do so yet.  The only thing that gets me up each day is knowing that I have a supportive family and friends on YUKU that actually get what I am going thru. \n\nJust keep holding out your hand and some experienced vets in this forum will give you excellent advice that will help you.  Do you best to follow that advice....",

    "Question": "PTSD (MST) Veteran Support Groups?\n\nGood afternoon everyone.\n\nI was wondering if the VA has PTSD (MST) Veteran Support Groups withing the VA medical system.  Currently, I am being treated by NP's, Psychiatrist and VA social workers for my treatment of PTSD MTS.  However, I sometimes think it might be helpful to discuss the problems and complicated feelings I experience each and minute of every day, with another soldier that has first hand experience?    Is anyone currently attending such meetings and if so is it helpful?\n\nHow can I bring this topic up with my VA doctor so I don't sound too pushy?  I just want to get better as soon as possible, because I hate this feeling of constant misery.  \n\nThank You\n\nPS I have recently submitted a claim for VA benefits for this issue.",
    "Response_1": "Yes, the VA has MST support groups for both men and women, as well as offering individual therapy.\n\nYou can call 1-800-827-1000, and VA will put you in touch with an MST coordinator in your area to find out what kinds of treatment are available. \n\nAlso, the VA provides free health care for physical and mental health conditions related to experiences of MST. No documentation of the MST experiences or disability compensation rating is required. Some vets may be able to receive this free MST-related health care even if they're not eligible for other VA care.\n\nThey can also be eligible for mileage reimbursement.",

Also, in addition to the classes/groups at your local VA, there are residential treatment programs within the VA that they can send you to. Some find it helpful to take a break from the day-to-day life, while getting treatment to deal with their trauma (I do believe that these are regional and the program you would attend is determined on where you live.)

    "Question": "Does it ever get better?\n\nI suffer from PTSD (Personal Assault) and I have been suffering for many years.  I struggle with the issues behind it and I have for so many years just put it in the back of my mind.  I am in weekly therapy and it helps but I just can't get rid of those damn nightmares!  I keep seeing his face, smell him, and I want to throw up...On top of his assault getting pregnant was just another reminder of the assault.  I lost the child due to a miscarriage and I have guilt over that.  Why did I lose the child?  Did I want the child?  What if I had the child?  The What if's!!!!  I feel so yuck...But I go every week to therapy with the hopes of one day at least getting the ability to move on from this.\n\nI asked my therapist the other day, \"Do you ever really heal?\".  Is there a point where you don't need therapy anymore?  I told her I felt cheated for not getting help sooner.  She said, that sometimes people are not ready for therapy at that specific time.  Maybe at the time I wasn't ready for therapy but I am now.  She said therapy can be a crutch to some and some can just continue to be heavily medicated but in reality you are never \"cured\" and sure while I might feel better some days, I will always feel that the therapy helps.  I am glad to have the therapy just wonder does it ever get better?",
    "Response_1": "Your therapist is both right, and wrong.  It is absolutely true that so far, there is no \"cure\" for PTSD.\n\nBUT, that does not mean that people with PTSD can not live a relatively normal life.  Unfortunately, you did not seek treatment immediately, and as a result, your attacker in effect seized control of your life.  Your brain is allowing that evil person to dominate your thoughts and dreams, because it continuously replays those events.  It has never learned not to give the perp that level of \"control over you\".  Without treatment, PTSD tends to \"feed on itself\" and get worse and worse. \n\nIt will take time for your brain to, in effect, rewire itself.\n\nWith the appropriate medications, and with the appropriate therapy, you can relearn how to take control of those areas once again.  I know that this is possible, because I am also a person that suffered sexual assaults as a kid.  I can never forget what happened, but I did learn to forgive the people that did that to me.  That is one of the things that therapy does, it helps you forgive the assault, and to also forgive yourself.  That does NOT mean you would not like to see that person \"burn in hell\", or the equivalent, but you leave that process up to whatever powers that be.\n\nWill you ever forget what happened?   No, you will not forget it.  BUT, you can learn to no longer allow that series of events to control your emotions; you can learn to be able to interact with people without fear crippling you; and you can learn to \"forgive\" yourself for your very mixed feelings about losing that baby.\n\nA baby is a part of you, and no matter how it was conceived, there is a strong bond between the baby and its mother.  Losing a baby is a VERY traumatic thing to the vast majority of women.  So, you in effect loaded more guilt, on top of your already badly scarred vision of yourself, and have been beating yourself up over it.\n\nYes, you can learn to live a pretty normal life once again.  It will be hard, and you will have to work hard to make this happen, but it will be worth the effort.",
    "Response_2": "My then wife was in a fatal car accident 25 years ago. She survived but not without multiple severe injuries that put her in a wheelchair for an extended period of time. She was eventually able to walk again (sort of), but was not able to return to work and has been on Social Security since the accident. She has had 13 surgeries since the accident and lives in constant pain.\n\nA couple of years after the accident she started having flashbacks that were very intense. She would suddenly start trembling and then become hysterical followed by severe depression. She was diagnosed with PTSD. \n\nWith medication and counseling she was able to come to terms with what had happened and her situation. Today, with the exception of her physical injuries, you would never know that she had suffered the trauma that she went through. She takes an anti-depressant because she does get mildly depressed at times over her inability to walk like other people and engage in physical activities with her grandchildren, but she hasn't suffered any problems with the PTSD in over 15 years. \n\nFrom observing her all these years I think that a big part of her recovery is the fact that she doesn't dwell on the accident. She can talk about it if you bring the subject up without any emotional turmoil, but it isn't something that she devotes any time to otherwise. To her it happened and she can't change that so she made a conscious effort to get on with her life as best she could with her disabilities. For several years after the accident she expressed a great deal of anger toward the drunk driver that caused the accident saying that she would like to dig him up (he died in the accident) and kill him again, but she hasn't said this for many years now. Given her physical pain and limitations I think that she has done a remarkable job. \n\nI guess my point is that after seeing how severe my wife's PTSD symptoms were when they first started and now see where she is today, I know that it is at least possible to come to grips with the condition and manage it effectively. I should also point out that the only disability benefits she ever got for her disabilities was about $1100 a month Social Security, not even remotely close to what she would have received if she had been a veteran. But then we got divorced and she got a hold of my Civil Service pension. LOL. I jokingly asked her if it was me that she wants to kill now instead of the drunk driver and I swear I saw a smile. \n\nGood luck in your journey. I wish you all the best.",
    "Response_3": "It will likely \"get better\" over time and therapy.  It will never \"go away\" anymore than a death of a loved one, a divorce, any life-changing event, but it will become manageable...sometimes with meds, sometimes with counseling and therapy, sometimes both approaches.

I have never felt so depressed and so hopeless as I.do now.",
    "Response_1": "I don't know what to say to make it better. I lost my father a couple years ago and the way in which he went was bad.

Making those appointments is a great start, and now comes the hard work of getting to and through each session.\n\nAs always with PTSD, improvements in quality of life come one step at a time, one day at a time.

    "Question": "Only been out two years.  In those two years, I have done nothing but dig myself deeper into this mental nightmare.  I have combat PTSD, and bipolar disorder.  Everyone who has PTSD needs to be aware of how these two ailments are connected.  I challenge each of you to search that out. One does not simply develop bipolar disorder at the age of 35.  I had PTSD first, and the bipolar came along afterwards. I don't even deal so much with the PTSD issues these days, besides anger fits and anxiety attacks, as the psychosis from the bipolar disorder have dominated my illness.  I don't even know what is real anymore.  My wife just talked to me, and informed me she is leaving me.  I don't blame her.  All I do is seclude myself in my basement, away from everyone else.  What is the point of it all?  Fifteen years I gave up my life for this country.  I was thrown out into the streets like a piece of garbage in the downsizing.  Now, with my wife leaving out the door, what is the point of anything?  I have no family. I can't work.  No friends. Nobody. Nothing to look forward too. Fuck it.  I am done.  I am just venting.",
    "Response_1": "Man I know how you feel I've been out since 2011 and I still suffer from severe symptoms(ptsd) I don't have bipolar so I can't comment on that. My wife left me too and it was a pretty $hi**y feeling I asked her for help and she told me I can't help you I'm leaving.\n\nI have no friends but the ones still in the army and the ones out now. I catch myself isolating sometime. I don't like dealing with people. \n\nThings will get better I have my bad days and I have my good days.",
    "Response_2": "I have PTSD and bipolar. Got out of military in 2009 and than worked in the Middle East for the United Nations until 2013 until I had mental breakdown. \n\nI left my wife because she was no help to me. I go to therapy and group and that's the only place I go. I hate going anywhere. I isolate all the time. Crawl up in a blanket on my couch everyday watch tv a veg out. I struggle everyday but keep driving on for on reason only I think.....my children.\n\ni am on 5 different meds don't know if they are working but that's what my doctor tells me to take. I hoping things will chang for the better. \n\nStay ray in the fight brother and don't give up.. Everyone is different. God bless you.",
    "Response_3": "I know this will go against every fiber inside of you, but if you can force yourself to become physically active in something, anything you will feel better. I forced myself to do this last summer and it made a big change in my schedule and the rut I was in mentally. For me, it only takes a couple of times doing something before it becomes a habit. Give it a try-- it'll be a big hurdle to clear but what have you got to lose?? A few days???",
    "Response_4": "Just in reading through this information it seems as though I to isolate myself (didn't really know that's what I do I just felt better staying in.) Since losing my job its become even harder to fight through this since it has pushed me into a depression. I will say the one thing that does bring me joy is coaching, it gets me out of the house, I enjoy seeing the kids achieve success and I feel like I am actually doing something good. Try to get out there and find something that makes you happy, it will take your mind off of your troubles even if its for a little while.",

    "Question": "Question about PTSD claim I am already 100/100 but still have a ?\n\nOn my last C&P (100/100 cuz of seizures from tbi. they think my brain will grow back lol but it�s getting worse) I told them I have PTSD (I originally didn�t think it was real). I described how my friend killed himself and how we had a lot of incoming irams/mortars/rockets/etc. and how missions had ieds etc. etc. and how 2 other friends had blown up n died. Anyways long story short I live by Campbell n they shot mortars all the time, and as time goes by loud noises are starting to get to me more and more and I am having a few flash backs and memories. SO my question is how do I make sure they do screw me out of my ptsd claim? Hell they gave 10% TBI n 100% seizure. I want to make sure they don�t fxck me over like last time.",
    "Response_1": "First of all, get help with your existing conditions. Keep your appointments and seek the best help possible thru your VA providers. A good papertrail is significent for any re-evaluations in the future and good for you in that it may relax some of your symptoms.\nYou are not rated P&T ? If not, you can apply for permanent and total status but they will review your entire file when you do.",
    "Response_2": "So exactly how were you screwed over last time? You had a head injury. You filed a claim for it. They awarded you a total disability rating. The nerve of those people. \n\nAnd now you want to file another claim and you want to make sure they don't screw you over again like they did the last time. \n\nI'm not going to say anything else for fear of getting censured by a moderator.",
    "Response_3": "I would NOT file the P&T but in the end it's up to you.\n\nIf you are already at 100% leave it alone anytime you file they will review every condition you have and you could end up at 90% when they finish. Worse off than you are now.\n\nDo as you wish but you really aren't providing a lot of good info for us to work with but that could be the TBI.",
    "Response_4": "Two little tidbits for ya:\n\n1.  A VA shrink will have to diagnose any PTSD...a VA shrink!  Then, you need an in-service event (no prob for you there) and  nexus tying the two together (again, no prob!)\n\n2.  On the other hand, if you file for PTSD (after gathering the junk they need for that, including and official VA shrink diagnosis), you entire claim folder is up for grabs and scrutiny.\n\nNow then, you can go to the Vet Center and ask for group or one on one counseling there without filing any claim.  You can also do the same at your VAMC, again, without disturbing your claim.  VHA and VBA do not communicate without a reason, and merely asking for treatment, without any claim, is a good move.",

    "Question": "Treatment\n\nSo some of you know me from my prior posts. I am going to the VA for treatment for PTSD since losing my job, the social worker says on her scale I am a 70 (I am rated at 50% service connected for PTSD.) I thought I should talk and get help if I am to get better and get a job, the social worker says that losing my job was likley due to my PTSD. My question I have here is the frequency that she wants me to go for our meetings and the distance is so far there is no way I can continue on with treatment if I find a job. ?I did file for IU and if granted I would feel better that the treatments could continue..I guess I am just curious and wanted to know what others thought",
    "Response_1": "First of all, you are not eligible for IU with a rating of 50%.\n\nThe Social Workers rating of \"70\" is meaningless. You need to file a claim for an increased rating, and see where that goes. I would STRONGLY recommend that you get a VSO to help you with this process.",

    "Response_2": "Since each persons body chemistry is slightly different than anyone elses, medications will act in different ways in each persons body.\n\nThe ONLY way to tell if a particular medication, or a combination of medications, works for you is to give it a try. Just remember that most of these tyupes of medications can take 4-8 weeks to reach their full effect. With some meds, you won't notice any effect for a week or more.\n\nBe patient, and LET YOUR DOCTOR KNOW HOW YOU ARE REACTING TO THE MEDICATION.",

    "Question": "Question about Reduction/Re Eval\n\nSo, I have been rated at 100% for PTSD/Depression for like 5 years now and I remember on my award letter it stated that I would be scedualed for a re evlauation at some later date and it listed a date that is already past. Previously I had been rated at like 30% but after a long fight and the appeal going all the way to the board of veteran appeals the judge ruled that I would be rated at 100%. On the C & P the doctor stated that I could not work and should be considered permantly and totally disabled for my PTSD. I did get my 100% rating later; however, it when I got the award letter it stated that it was subject to be reviewed. I am worried that it will be reduced, my question is was that just put in the paperwork as one of those deals where it probably will never be reviewed but it could or will if definatly be reviewed since there was a scedualed date to be reviewed that has already past? This concerns me because with the treatment I have recieved I am feeling and doing better and my VSO said if they re evaled me I would be reduced but he has not seen it happen due to the huge backlog. Someone please give me a piece of mind or something. Thank you, I don't know what I would do if it got reduced because its all I have to support my family.",
    "Response_1": "The VA tends to re-evaluate those with 100% SC'd issues like yours. In order for a reduction to occur a person would have to show improvement on 2 C&P exams in a row.\n\nThat came from the Regional Office in Roanoke, Virginia. Again the rating is based on ALL the evidence not just one piece.",

    "Question": "SOMETHING HAPPEND\n\nRecently my PTSD has me bothered I've been paranoid having that scarry feeling in your stomach and heart racing I catch my self day dreaming about Iraq and things that occurred things I've done. I can see my heart beat threw my shirt. I've been isolating I only goto take my son to school and the grocery store. We usually have a good time but the last month I've been isolating and having depression and not even wanting to play with my own son. What's wrong with me am I a bad dad? he's five and dont understand, plus I'm a single father. I take medication but the doc has stopped most of them that where working and I was feeling good. But now I feel like $h!* I haven't been sleeping but 3hrs roughly a night . I'm confused. I don't know what to do.. I feel like screaming... I recently smoked pot to get an appetite does that make me a drug addict? I don't eat much myself I'll cook my son food and take care of him but when it come to myself I don't want to do anything.. don't worry I didn't smoke around my son. I'm lost I have an appointment Feb 1st with my social worker and one with my med doc. I feel like giving up sometimes but my son keeps me going. I hate putting on a front on how I feel. Sometimes I don't tell my social worker everything because I'm scared of what she will say or do, I've done emdr, prolong exposure, cognitive therapy they don't seem to work.. I'm not sure what to do I've been dealing with this for a loooong time.",
    "Response_1": "No, Brother...you are not a \"bad Dad\"...just having a tough time of things for the moment.\n\nYour meds have changed and it sounds like that is what kicked this deal off.  Talk to your doc NOW!  Tell him about everything and ask for a cocktail...I doubt group sessions will help the immediate problem.\n\nMake sense??",
    "Response_2": "Do NOT wait till Feb 1, get to the VA Emergency room, and be totally honest with them. You have to get help with this.",
    "Response_3": "I�m not a single dad, but I am a father to two girls (one is 5 and the other is 7). I feel much the same way you do. I feel like I put on a front most of the time and I�m usually just miserable in my head. Playing with my kids is hard. I just don�t have the energy in me at times. \n\nI second what was said in a post above, just go to the VA. I usually skip the emergency room and just go right to the check-in desk in mental health. I�ve done this in multiple hospitals over many years and they always can get me someone to talk to within 30-60 minutes. If you can�t talk to someone in mental health, seek someone out in the OIF/OEF program office at your VA. I�ve talked to those people multiple times as well. Going to the VA for a few hours and telling someone how you feel and then getting some sort of an action plan will help you feel better � I guarantee it. \n\nYou don�t have to feel like you are on the verge of suicide to get immediate attention. They will take you seriously. \n\nThe same sort of Soldier attitude that got you through your time in Iraq and gets you through the day with your son is exactly what you need to have to keep going now. Things are tough and feel hopeless, but you have to Soldier on and keep doing what you need to do. You need to be there for your son and you need to keep going to treatment. I don't know if your area has this program, but I'm in a program called PRRC which stands for something like \"psycho-social rehabilitation resource community\". I know they have it at other VAs in the country. Basically they have a number of groups, therapies, and classes to attend every day. They give you a free meal voucher and you get reimbursed for travel expenses for every day that you show up. Some of the classes are more helpful than others and there are all sorts of people in the program with different psychological issues, but I've found a bunch of guys that I bond with which is the big benefit to me. It gets you out of the house, into treatment, and gets you to interact with other vets and not feel so alone out there.\n\nI'm kind of reading in between the lines here, but if you are feeling suicidal or like you do have suicidal thoughts they don't necessarily automatically commit you if you tell them that - I know from first hand experience. If you tell them that you are going to go home, get drunk, and slash your wrists in the tub this afternoon they'll probably act on that, but if you tell them that you feel better off dead or that sort of thing they won't commit you. I attempted suicide in front of my wife and my kids walked in on me bleeding all over the kitchen and screaming at my wife. That sort of thing will stick with them forever. Get treatment before that happens.\n\nI also hold back stuff from my treatment team. I don't know why, but I do. I understand where you are coming from on that.\n\nAs far as you smoking to try to feel better, give yourself a break. You might roll your eyes at this thought, but at any given moment you are just trying to do the very best you can to feel better. It�s not like you did anything awful like torture puppies or masturbate in the middle of chuck-e-cheese�s in front of a crowd of kids and parents to make yourself feel better (at least I�m going to give you the benefit of the doubt and assume you didn�t). It sounds like you give a crap about your son and that puts you leaps and bounds above many fathers out there.",
    "Response_4": "You sound like me with your original post.  I feel nothing out of anything I do.  Like I am blank.  I have been isolating myself since I got out of the Army.  I have held down jobs, but that is all an act.  I would act as a functioning member of society, and when I would get home, back to the isolation.  Then, the isolating turned into craziness.  I experienced a manic state while on an antidepressant for a little over 6 months after my initial dose.  Antidepressants can actually bring on mania, turns out.  I was given the antidepressant for what was determined as depression due to the PTSD when I was originally diagnosed by the Army.  I left the Army too quickly to establish any sort of treatment, so scripts for antidepressants are what I got out of the deal.  I kept putting off going to the VA, although I knew that I needed to.  \n\nI was given healthcare through the Army for my first six months from my ETS, but I either blew off treatment, or thought I had it under control with just the meds.   That first manic state was the start of a deep psychosis that I entered  and lasted a year until I finally sought help after quitting my job one day, while in that mania.  The mania turned into anger, and I was on the verge of losing control of that anger.  The VA originally turned me away, and I had to tell off the dude at the front about what I was experiencing on my way out the door to get them to see me.  Turns out, based on my last C&P, that I developed Bipolar disorder as a progression from my original diagnosis of PTSD.  One caused the other...  \n\nI am deep into treatment now, and have the bipolar almost completely under control.  The bad part now is that I don't only have the memories from combat to contend with, but I also have the memories of my interactions for almost a year where I went off the deep end.  I got into a lot of conspiracy subjects of varying degrees of lunacy.  My manic states encouraged me to make all kinds of grandious statements to those around me or on social media about all kinds of subjects, that are now embaracing to say the least.  Keep on keeping on... There has got to be light at the end of this tunnel at some point.  All we can do is keep moving forward.",

Most big companies do, and you should file for that IMMEDIATELY.\n\n2. You REALLY need to get yourself into CONCENTRATED treatment. There is no reason why you should be looking at permanent unemployment, as most PTSD is treatable (even where the cause is MST).\n\n3. If you do have a company disability insurance program, they will help you with an SSDI application, and the insurance company will provide a free lawyer, take care of any additional examinations/tresting you might need, etc., at no cost to you. They do this because they can deduct any SSDI payment from what you receive in disability payments.\n\nYour absolute Number 1 goal should be to get the level of treatment that you need. It's hard, and I know that you are reluctant to have to go into all of this, but it WILL pay off in the long run if you really cooperate with treatment. You may need medications, and if you do, TRY THEM and report accurately to your treating folks how they are affecting you.

I was even offered a promotion to stay but to me right now in my life, none of that matters. The VA came in the nic of time when i feel all was lost, and rated me 100% P&T, I took it as a sign from the good lord, and now i am getting help for the last few months, A big part of my treatment is to pick up hobbies, im sure you all know what i am talking about, seems to be pretty common thing during this type of mental treatment. I am extremely lost, its been 3 weeks since this \"hobby\" thing was pushed on me, and i am still standing here with a question mark over my head.

It gets you out and you can concentrate on one topic/subject at a time.....\"Bridges, Elevators, pianos, etc., etc. (I download mine and make slide shows of them in Power Point....even learned how to place a music track on the slide show)...make family albums on CD for people.

    "Response_2": "Tough question for someone else other than yourself to answer. I believe you must have an interest within you in order to follow thru with any.\nLike Dan, I play guitar. Great therapy for me - close my eyes and take off to wherever my imagination wants to lead me. But without a core interest to do this- I wouldn't touch the instrument. I just really believe you cannot force yourself into an interest but search yourself and find something that you wish you knew or knew how to do then check into that. Youtube is great at having instructions, etc on just about everything imaginable.",

A good plan for today, is much better than the perfect plan for tomorrow.  There is a hobby section here on the VBN site.  Read through the posts, you never know what you will find.  For a lot of us, the VBN site is a hobby of sorts. It allows us the ability to feel relevant.",

    "Question": "I have PTSD\n\nI have PTSD and Ive been going to the VA continuously for the last 3-4 years but ive only been able to see and talk to a nurse practitioner and a social worker. Apparently psychologists  are hard to come by where I live in the VA offices. Is this a bad thing if I decide to get an increase in my disability %? I do believe that I do not render a 50% rating, life has become harder, and worse for me. All of which ive stated to my social worker and multiple doctors that I see 1-2 times a month for therapy.",
    "Response_1": "Your treatment records will be VERY important in getting an increased rating. Those records should indicate that you have gotten worse over time, and that your PTSD is causing significantly more problems with your day to day life.\n\nNot a lot of VA Psychologists do a lot of therapy. In all too many cases, Social Workers and Counselors do the primary therapy for the majority of veterans.\n\nIf you do not have a Veterans Service Officer (VSO), I would STRONGLY recommend that you get one.",
    "Response_2": "Almost gives the impression that they are working for the Government and not for the patient.  I say they should get rid of the VHA and give Vets a waiver for insurance of their choosing off the exchanges.  I can never get an appointment within a 2 month period. This is the stuff the general public has no idea about, nor do I believe that they care.",
    "Response_3": "Getting in to see a Psychiatrist seems to be getting more and more difficult. I have overheard phone conversations between the receptionists and a vet wanting an app't with the Psychiatrist, while I was sitting in the waiting room. Seems that 2-3 months down the road is about average. Can't help but think, what if that vet is in a dire situation mentally. I guess that there is always the ER -- but it shouldn't have to be that way.",

    "Question": "PTSD\n\nI don't know where to begin but I will try. I was in the service from 1992 until 2006. I am currently rated at 100% for various conditions and my highest single rating of 70% for ptsd and severe depression. This might sound odd but in 2013 my dog died and it triggered me about past events and I could not handle it. I was doing good before that, watched both parents die etc. But when my dog died,,done...So now it is 2016 and I visit the \"mental doc\" twice a year if he is available but I was regulated to talk to a social worker every week. My \"mental doc\" has been on leave with out pay for over six months...I have missed a substantial amount of work in the last three years and the social worker suggested that I should look at different avenues. Her response was to apply for SSDI and go from there since you are 100%. The thing is that I am a federal employee and when I brought the paperwork to her she said no problem our primary doc will fill it out. Yesterday the primary clinic called and asked about the reason for the paperwork and explained that I was applying for federal disability retirement. Main reason, PTSD...Today I got phone call from social worker saying that primary doc will not fill out paperwork since he is not \"mental doc\". She still insisted that I was going to be ok since I was 100% and told me to walk in to the VA hospital on Tuesday to talk to someone and gave me a contact. I was so pissed off that for one can you please give them an heads up about my situation before I arrive..Her response was well they don't like that. So she mentioned the patient advocate and I called. Real friendly lady, as I was basically crying because this is a major life decision...who wants to give in to not working and a pride issue...She provided me the number to contact about my sitiuation. I called and it turns out they are overwhelmed with my \"mental Doctor\" backlog and I will be there Monday to fill out my federal disability paperwork....I am sorry for the long post...also one thing that annoyed me was my social worker suggesting that I get an outside source...maybe I should take her up on that....I love telling my background over and over again to different folks at the VA like I am reliving it again. With the positive this board had been great to me with research and reading fellow vet post for years now..sorry to vent",
    "Response_1": "You are making a very difficult decision, and it sounds like the right one. I cant speak to the paperwork and waiting as you know that will be the sa,e old frustration you have already endured to obtain VA disability. \n\nI would like to say that in most areas they VA does not have the docs to stay up with the patients, but dont give up on that a good doc can make all the difference with this difficult transition. \n\nOne of my biggest helps was found in going to group meetings, they are available much more regularly available than your doctors appointments, usually weekly. It is amazing how many in your groups have been down the road your traveling and can point the way to help you through this difficult time.",
    "Response_2": "A relationship with a dog is very different. Many people, especially people with PTSD are closer emotionally to their dog, than they are to most people. Dogs accept you totally, and they don't give a damn whether you are in good shape or not. So, their dog dying often triggers a meltdown. You are NOT alone in having that happen. It is IMPORTANT that you get another dog, because they are very supportive emotionally. Get a shelter dog that needs YOU as much as you need them.\n\nYou have several options available to you. Since you are a Federal Employee, you can go out on disability, without losing your seniority. You could also file for a disability retirement through FERS. Your personnel office can help you with this.\n\nYour social worker does not know much about SSDI (not surprising, most don't). Having a 100% S/C rating does NOT guarantee that you would get SSDI. BUT, it certainly helps to have that rating.\n\nYou do NOT need to have anyone fill out any forms to apply for SSDI. Statements from your docs really don't help, unless they are backed up by clinical evidence. The best evidence is your ongoing treatment records.\n\nYou can call your local Social Security Office, or go in person, and apply. They will obtain ALL of your VA Medical Records, etc. I would suggest that you make a copy of every page of the decision granting you 100%, and give that to Social Security when you apply. That includes the \"Statement of the Case\", which is the explanation of WHY they granted you the 100% rating.\n\nYou obviously need more treatment than you are currently getting. Become the \"squeaky wheel\", and demand to be assigned to a Mental Health Doctor that is actually working for the VA. Your doc being gone is NOT helping you, you need someone that is actually there. You may need a change in medications, more intense therapy, etc., etc. Waiting for this person to come back is NOT a good idea at all.\n\nYour situation is not at all unusual. You just need some assistance navigating the system.\n\nFell free to come back here and talk out anything on your mind. We DO understand, and most will try their best to be supportive and help in any way that we can.",

We will see. \n\nI got my third dui christmas day , going to see my family in a town 200 miles away.After one of my sons picking me up and bringing me to the family they became concerned about my health and took me to a hospital em room. My pulse rate was 180 and in fibulation for 3 days.Checked myself out on the 4th day and 1 hour later was in another hospital that specializes in PTSD and alcohol/drug  problems . 9 days later the va refused to pay and i was on the streets.

I waited in parking lot(afraid of drinking) and was readmitted at 4 pm. Thisplace s the one active duty are placed in. The ptsd program was very intense and brought me to tears many times.

    "Question": "What does 70% look like?\n\nHi all. Rated 50% for PTSD w/ MDD and some other stuff for my back and arms but really think I fit the bill for 70% mental health. I'm wondering if I'm being overly critical of myself\n\nJust reading the schedule I feel it fits me perfect. I bolded the parts I think fit me: 70% rating: Unable to function in most social and work areas with symptoms such as obsessive behaviors, illogical speech, depression and panic so persistent that it interferes with ability to function, suicidal thinking, inability to control impulses (including becoming violent without provocation), neglecting self-care such as hygiene, inability to handle stress, and/or inability to maintain relationships.\n\nI can't maintain friendships because I think everyone's trying to f with me so I cut them off and keep to myself, i'm depressed and/or panicked all the time to the point I can't really do or enjoy anything, my thoughts always come back to killing or harming myself in some way, i'm not violent towards others but if I think someones trying to mess with me i will gtfo in a hurry & can't stop myself, I usually make myself somewhat presentable if I have to interact with people but I don't try to make myself pretty or anything, can't handle stress without drugs or 1 week+ of alone time to cope, and yeah can't maintain relationships.\n\nThe past exams don't agree with me however, saying I'm only 50%. Do I have to check all the boxes to be rated 70%? I really don't see how I can get or keep a job when I'm like this, I'd just disappear after the first few days when I think someone's trying to hurt &/or fuck me. Does excessive paranoia count as obsessive behavior?\n\nOkay sorry this was a huge post, I'm terrigble at being brief. Is the VA just trying to keep in budget by denying my claim for 4+ years or am I really not as crazy as I think I am? If you made it this far thanks for sticking with it =).",
    "Response_1": "I was rated 70 PTSD for about 3 years until awarded IU. I think you might qualify for 70 and IU but just go for 70 right now. If your disabilities get worse then you have a good chance of IU. Just keep detailed documentation of your work environment and talk to your therapist about daily struggles at work. I personally ecountered a lot of disability harassment from every job I had until I couldnt work anymore. You dont need to check every single box to get an increase to 70 but you might for 100 or IU. I was able to hold down a great managment job and maintain a high level of hygene while rated 70. working was the only thing I could do while rated 70 and I had no friends or did any type of socialization. I have one question. Do you see a therapist regularly? If not then start so they can diagnose you better.",
    "Response_2": "I had a 70% rating for PTSD for nearly five years before I crashed into the 100% rating.\n\nFrom my personal experience it seems that documentation is everything. You might think you are 70% and you might really be 70% but unless you have documentation to substantiate your problems, then you probably won't get rated accordingly.\n\nIf you are having suicide ideation, have you discussed it at all with your treatment team? If you are having problems at work do you have performance reports that indicate that? Have you had any disciplinary problems at work? What about your relationship with your spouse? Marriage counseling? Anything and everything needs to be added as evidence.\n\nWhen I was first rated 70% I was seeing a doctor probably 2-3 times a month and I was taking one medication for depression. I had just been suspended for 5 weeks from work and my relationship with my spouse was heading south. I made friends with the OIF/OEF program manager and anytime something bothered me, I went to his office to talk. Unknown to me, anytime I visited him he wrote nearly everything I said in my VA file - which proved to be a huge help in me getting 70%. For the most part my personal hygiene was alright. I let my hair and beard grow out and I wore some very worn-out clothes, but I showered daily. I started to have some fairly regular flashbacks and I would lose track of where I was or forget that I was driving when I would be driving a car. Nightmares and screaming in my sleep were fairly regular occurrences (1-3 times a week). Drinking was starting to increase, but it was manageable. I was drinking maybe 3 beers a day on the weekday and maybe 6 per day on the weekend.\n\nThe bottom line, if you think you are 70% the raters are expecting you to look like you are 70%. To me, I would guess you should be in fairly regular therapy (i.e. appointments a couple of times a month), on medication, and having obvious issues with civilian life which can be documented.\n\nHowever, be careful what you wish for. Seeking a higher disability rating is a double-edged sword. The money makes life easier, but you have a higher rating because your life isn't easy. I recently was bumped up to %100 P&T and my life really sucks. Getting the disability money makes my life easier now that I'm dealing with some pretty intense psychiatric issues, but my life was a lot more enjoyable and easier when I didn't have the 100% rating and I was able to work a job and live a fairly normal life.",

    "Response_1": "As someone still in search of a service dog I have been doing a lot of research. The places I have talked to all prefer there not be another dog in the home at the time the service dog is placed.......after placement and a bonding time for dog and owner they did not have a problem.",
    "Response_2": "In my experience with dogs, some will bond with another dog (if one is present) more so than with their human since they are pack animals.  They go through stages (small windows) as a puppy, one of which is the bonding process.  I think it's not a good idea.  Just my 2 cents.",
    "Response_3": "It depends on the human.  If the human leads the dogs then they will look to the human as the pack leader and do what the human wants (after training).  I have three dogs who take my direction on everything.  They are good dogs because they have been consistently trained to do what I want and not what they want.  \n\nOne of the problems that can arise, in introducing a second dog into a household-that training will not completely remedy, is if you are not careful and purchase an \"alpha\" and the service dog is also an \"alpha\".  You will be in for some long term dog snarling.  Personally, I would stay with the single dog and avoid the drama because, usually, once you get a dog, you keep it.  The wrong dog can lead to ten to fourteen years of trouble.\n\\\nGood luck on the decision.",

Please excuse my grammar and spelling.\n\nWithout getting into the disgusting and unimaginable and sicking details, I have very recently notified my VA doctor (in writing because I could not actually speak the words) and my wife of 26 years (same thing, in witting) of this problem that occurred back in 1986 while serving in Germany.  On Monday, I have my first of what I will believe to be many psychiatric appointments with the VA or even private doctors.\n\nOver the years, I have been prescribed by private doctors many of the common mood and anxiety medications (Elivile, Triavile, Busporine, Paxil, Welbertin, Ambien, ect....) in order to treat, what I described to them as anxiety, OCD and sleeplessness. I simply could not discuss this problem that had occurred in Germany with anyone. At least, until now.  None of the medications helped to eliminate or reduce my panic attacks, re-living the rape experience, sleeplessness, OCD or plain old unusual and bizarre behavior.  However, I did get some relief and good sleep from Diazapam.  Unfortunately, this medication is or was only used for short term, so I was taken off if it after about a week.\n\nIt is my understanding that Xanax is similar to Diazapam?  Is this a medication that can or be used for PTSD?  Should I ask my VA doctor about this medicine, or should I go thru the other more standard or typical mood enhancing products until a solution is found?\n\nThanks in advance",
    "Response_1": "VA Doctors can, and do, provide paperwork to allow people to take time off from work.\n\nIf your employer has Short-Term Disability Insurance, it would be a very good idea to consider filing for it. Then, you may want to consider the possibility of inpatient treatment, to get things under control and to get you regulated with medication.\n\nWhat you are describing are MINIMAL doses of those medications. They should NOT make you feel like a \"Zombie\". You need to tell your treating doc about exactly how you are feeling.\n\nWhat you are describing are classic symptoms of PTSD and Depression.

At the same time I was awarded the rating I got a job offer as an analyst making nearly $60k a year.  I worked for about a year and 4 months but wasn't able to handle the stress and it started to aggravate my disabilities.  I quit about 7-8 months ago.\n\nIt use to say in ebenefits that I was scheduled for a reduction on Jan 1, 2016 but that has come and gone and i didn't get reduced.  I also am terribly in debt and need to work again t supplement some additional income, I'm disregarding my disability in order to pay off my debt.\n\nMy question to you all is, can I be reduced by the va for my 100% PTSD rating for having a job?  Please advise.",
    "Response_1": "One of the requirements for a 100% rating for any mental disorder is total occupational and social impairment.\n\nSo, if you work on a regular basis, you will get reduced at some point in time. Being able to work a regular job is really not compatible with a 100% rating.",
    "Response_2": "You are allowed to work a long as it's 100% without IU.\n\nMost folks have trouble holding onto a job just as you mentioned above but you are allowed to and it's not a factor in reducing your benefits.\n\nThey can look at it in a new C&P to decide if you have gotten better in order to reduce it but you probably will not get better(in my opinion).",
    "Response_3": "As long as it's not IU you can legally work at 100% PTSD. \n\nOn the contrary, ONE of the MANY requirements to OBTAIN 100% PTSD is TOTAL OCCUPATIONAL AND SOCIAL IMPAIRMENT. \n\nPhilly once stated in another thread that he has NEVER seen a scheduler 100% PTSD get reduced because of working BUT he has seen MANY 100% IU's reduced because of working. \n\nSeeing as how I'm not a rater I will refrain from personal judgment on this. It's YOUR life.\n\nSomething people need to know as well. To receive 100% for a Mental Condition you DO NOT have to have total occupational and social impairment. It is only ONE of the many symptoms. \n\nAn individual, in theory, could exhibit many of the other symptoms which fall under the 100% criteria as well as symptoms which fall in the 70% or even 50% criteria and STILL be rated at 100% mental. \n\nThese ratings are assigned on a case by case basis. Some claims are the same but many are different.",
    "Response_4": "The rating for 100% mental health....isn't speculation. Are you Permanant or scheduled for a review? Anyway if scheduled for a review and working successfully, you should be rated accordingly. So no problem.",
    "Response_5": "100% = \"Totally Socially and OCCUPATIONALLY disabled\", so...if you can and are working, you are NOT Occupationally disabled.\n\nMental Health ratings are the only ones, really, that have a fine line (though any disability that says totally occupationally disabled should receive the same attention!)\n\nYou roills your dice, you takes your chances...your call!"

    "Question": "I am currently rated at 70% PTSD non combat trying for IU 100%\n\nHello Everyone, I am new to this site and don't understand all the abrevs for things, but I have a total va disability rating of 80%. 10% tinnitus, 10% hearing loss, and as of March 2012 70% PTSD.  My vso said that I should try for IU and I did as of April 2012.  I know it's usually a long process, but my PTSD claim with the C&P exam took only 5 months.  I go to my va psychiatrist every 6 weeks, my social worker at the va every 2 weeks.  I do not get records figuring that the va can see them any time they want.  My symptoms are no better and have gotten worse if anything. I am on SSDI because of a few large failed back surgeries that are not service connected.  I asked my vso when i applied for IU that my back is the reason I am on SS.  He told me it didn't matter.  His words were \" who would hire someone if they are 70% PTSD \".  My questions are :  I have not heard anything since I applied almost a year ago except for 2 different letters saying they are looking at my case.  Will I have to go through another C&P exam?  Do I get retro pay from the day that I put in the request for IU?  I've only called my vso twice in the last 10 months and he sounds as if I'm a pain in his ass.  Also, I hope I didn't create any waves by doing what i did one month following my initial 70% rating for PTSD.  Please let me know your opinions on this.  Thank you so much",
    "Response_1": "When considering IU claims, the VA does everything they can to ensure that there is nothing to question.  I did not see anything written on how long you have not worked in total, I did not see anything as to whether your former employers sent in their information that is required.\n\nSince I went through the IU process from 6/22/11 - 2/29/12 until I was approved, you need to understand that a request for TDIU is also in the same instance an informal request for increase at the same time. At least that is how mine was treated. Each of my service connected disabilities were AGAIN evaluated to see if they had increased (I assume in an effort to bring me to a scheduler 100% rating which would make the IU a moot point and processing terminated).  \n\nEven though you had a C&P for your initial rating for PTSD and the other issues, it is the evaluators decision if you need another. For IU award there must be an examiner and the VA Examiner must clarify why they feel you are not employable based on your illness/service connected injuries.  They did this in my case. The doctor had to provide clarification and rationale as to why they feel each of my conditions did not allow me to participate in substantially gainful employment.  Have you stated or written the VA that your conditions have worsened to the VA through your VSO or did it yourself?\n\nAs far as your VSO's comments about who would hire someone with 70% PTSD, this is my comment: there are many policemen, firefighters, various levels of law enforcement they have these individuals along with the United States Post Office. PTSD is not just a service issue and as you knows thousands to more likely millions have been traumatized at some time in their lives without their employers even having an inkling.  Your case is officially documented by the VA, so it is easier to know.  Just food for thought regarding your VSO's comments. Nothing should ever be taken for assumption or granted, only what can be proved by evidence.\n\nIf your TDIU claim is approved, it will go back to your effective date of claim (mine did) and any retro will be for the 1st of the month beginning after your effective date (I received all pay back to July 1, 2011 (my claim date was June 22, 2011) even though my decision came on 2/29/12.\n\nGood fortune (I never say luck) in your future decision on TDIU.\n\nRetired TopKick (United States Army 1974-2002)\n100% TDIU (2/29/12)\nSSDI (5/7/12)\n90% Combined (93% w/Bilaterals)\nCurrently Undergoing DRO Review (10 Contentions Since 5/16/11)\n\n\"Never Make Anyone A Priority In Your Life That Makes You An Option In Theirs!",
    "Response_2": "I have gone through at least 5 different C&P's. If you are scheduled for another it is a good sign that your case is moving along. You can also register at eBenefits and check your progress online but believe me, it won't make it move any faster. Good luck and don't give up.",
    "Response_3": "You are refering to effective date of the claim. It can be the date you file for IU. If your awarded IU it will be effective the first time day the medical documentation supports you as unemployable. In my case I filed in Nov of 2011 but my effective date was placed as July 22 of 2011 due to the medical evidence supporting that date.",
    "Response_4": "With your particular ratings at this time, you might be awarded IU. I was, with similar ratings. However, you will need to prove that you cannot secure or maintain gainful employment due to your service connected disabilities.\n\nIf I were you, I'd get a copy of my progress notes with your psychiatrist and social worker. Get those from Release of Information department. I'd want to see what they are saying in the notes, so that I would have some idea what type of information I need to provide. These progress notes are going to be important to any future rating.\n\nIn my case, my psychiatrist inserted a statement in my progress notes stating that I was unable to secure or maintain gainful employment due to my PTSD symptoms. A counselor at the Vet Center also provided a letter going into detail about my symptoms and a similar statement regarding my unemployability.\n\nI also had a C&P that was supportive to my IU claim, and in which the examiner quoted the statement in my progress notes.\n\nAnd finally I provided various financial information at the VAs request. With that information I included explanatory statements.\n\nOne way or the other you will need to provide proof for your claim. Maybe that is all in your progress notes. But right now you don't know. So again, I'd get copies of the progress notes and go from there.\n\nBest of luck.",

    "Question": "Confused by VA please help\n\nOk Gents, I recently started seeing a different Va Claims Rep and once I was checked in and had him documented as my confirmed rep through the Va he had me give him my whole history in the Marine Corps.  After explaining everything to him I told him that I needed to see about having my current percentages raised because of continued and rising pains.  After explaining all of my issues to him he asked me why I wasn't service connected for TBI/PTSD.  I told him that I was s/c for TBI at 0 percent (which I never appealled until now) and that I never put in for PTSD. He explained that all of my issues were PTSD related and recommended that I see a doctor.  I scheduled an appointment with a doctor and after said appointment he diagnosed me with PTSD and cognitive issues secondary to my TBI.  After filing my claim for PTSD and TBI percentage raise with the doctors diagnoses I waited and waited and waited.  Finally I recieved two packets for QTC appointments and once was to a psychiatrist (the same one that diagnosed me with ptsd) and another with a psycologist.  I was just curious why the va set me up with an appointment with a doctor they hired to examine me that has already examined me and diagnosed me with ptsd?  That just seems too good to be true...However I have another appointment with a psycologist which I'm assuming is for my TBI.  Can someone provide some reasoning for this?  Thanks in advance brothers.",
    "Response_1": "It is not at all uncommon for the VA to schedule an appointment with a physician that has seen you before. After all, they have the advantage of already knowing your issues, etc. The VA may only need a small amount of information from him/her, in order to determine just how impaired you are.\n\nLots of people read others posts, but don't know how to reply to them.",
    "Response_2": "Only thing I can think of is a second opinion. My PTSD C&P exam was only 15 minutes, all the guy wanted to do was to double check that I had the stressors and the symptoms (according to him). I believe they went off the psychologists that I had been seeing at the time for my rating. I have never been tested for TBI even though that psychologist thought I might should get tested due to the proximity of the artillery rounds hitting next to my Track while we where on top trying to fix it and the blasts almost throwing us off a few times.",

    "Response_1": "I am in week 4 of Tomah's inpatient 60 day program. The staff here is very good. The nurses go above and beyond. It's not easy (for me ), but I would recommend trying it if you have the chance. Chow ain't bad either.",
    "Response_2": "Many I have spoke with about inpatient stays have great things to say about it. I didn't make it through inpatient as it became untherapeutic (social anxieties especially with military associations) for me and I went to outpatient then to intensive outpatient. My point is odds are you will have a great experience, if you dont there are great alternatives. Just get the treatment it will help.",

    "Question": "Trying to get increase..????????\n\nHello friends!!! Happy New Year..\n\nI was awarded 10% ptsd after fighting for at least 6 years.. Well,, saw this as a low ball.. I quickly did an appeal.. I also got my VA pych docotor to fill out the necessary forms for an evaluation and she placed me at the findings below.. My Gaf was 70 with the following info.\n\nOccupational and social impairment with occasional decrease in work efficiency and intermittent periods of inability to perform occupational tasks (although generally functioning satisfactorily, with routine behavior, self-care, and conversation normal), due to such symptoms as: depressed mood, anxiety, suspiciousness, panic attacks (weekly or less often), chronic sleep impairment, mild memory loss (such as forgetting names, directions, recent events) ............................ 30% \n\nQuestion,... How likely is it that my appeal will be increased.. This information that I submitted was new and submitted after the filing of my appeal.. Pls. Help!",
    "Response_1": "GAF is no longer used...not sure why your shrink wouldn't now that?  In any case, a 70 wouldn't be very helpful for any  increase.\n\nThe criteria mentioned will be weighed against the lower criteria (raters consider more than a check-box and have latitude in applying those scales.)\n\nI hate \"WAGs\", but you may remain the same and at best what is described may be a 30%...it all depends upon other considerations and history.",

    "Question": "Psych MD: Statement on current condition & prognosis\n\nSo I got everything squared away with the VA last year, and rated at 70% for PTSD, but the NG is just finally starting on get me processed through their disability evaluation (MEB).  Because they dragged ass all of my records & VA exams are older than 6 months & the guard needs everything for the prior 6 months. They have my pertinent histortical documention, but they a statement (not a full evalution) from my current treating psychiatrist (non-VA civilian/retired military).\n\nThey've got my medical records, but they're unwilling to interpret those and have requested a direct statement from my treating,  I've already  talked with him & he's more than willing to help out.\n\nThe only specifics I got for the contents are very vague.\n\n-Medications (dosage, etc.)\n-Any Medications related to your illness/injury\n-Treatment plan and prognosis to include statement from Psych MD stating whether you may be deployed to austere isolated areas without access to mental health specialists or medications. \n\nI already figure I should have him directly address my current psychological fitness for remaining in the military, along with my current psychological fitness for being deployed in a combat zone (and as an E-6 in particular, my ability to handle the responsibility of managing junior service members in such an environment) and his long-term prognosis for my ability to recover enough to continue my military service and be world wide deployable.\n\n can't even think about my service tours overseas, let alone consider deploying back to open. I can barely maintain a job and keep my family together; I'm getting to work 3 hours early every morning to keep up my with daily ticket queue, and I'm on a whole spectrum of medications that the guard has already said disqualifies me from being in the service.\n\n What kind of VA/DOD medical terminology, or specific areas should be addressed and included?\n\n I sincerely appreciate any guidance.",
    "Response_1": "Went through the same thing\n\nIn my case I went through pretty much the exact same thing.  I popped up as having a profile for PTSD related to a Post Deployment Health Assessment from 2005 in 2013!  I was told that I had to seek treatment or just face a general discharge.  The whole process is dumb the way it works.  I too was rated for PTSD and other conditions prior to my MEB even being initiated.  The thing that they need for the auster environment is strictly for a profile.  With the VA, especially because you have to tell your doctor you need something, then they have to draft it, and then the secretaries have to send it to you, or fax it to your unit, it is a hassle and then some.  If your doctor states exactly what you are diagnosed with, your prognosis, and your medications, and whether or not you will eventually get well enough to continue service, that right there should justify the issuing of a permanent profile.  (Especially if he/she states that you will not get better with treatment).  At that point, you should be scheduled for an MMRB, and the officer you see for that will decide whether or not you meet retention standards according to the provider's statement.  If you are rated at 70% from the VA for PTSD alone, there is no way you will be found fit for duty, in my opinion.  Hope this helps.  If you have any other questions feel free to hit me up.  I worked as a PSG for CBWTU-IL before it was deactivated and am very familiar with the whole process as far as MEB/PEB goes.  The stuff after that is where I get lost ha.  Take care!",
    "Response_2": "He should provide EXACTLY the information requested by the Guard, and include an overall assessment of your conditions and treatment.",
    "Response_3": "I Just recently retired form the CA ANG, prior to my retirement I was unable to take the full PT test fro 5 years due to both SC and non-SC conditions. The medical team left it up to my unit commander if he wanted me to be processed out on a medical or to let me stay in until my retirement after the first 3 wavered tests. They together decided to drag their feet on the MEB and let me stay as a trainer for the younger guys. Even after i was rated 60% combined with the largest being 50% PTSD by the VA. But in the mean time I had to get ALL of my medical records and notes from both the VA and my outside doctor (for the time I had one) so that he could make it look like he was proccessing me for an MEB prior to my retirement. A lot will depend on the medical doc, you unit and how close you are to retirement. My SC conditions where from the USMC back in 88-92 and one which was not SC by the VA even though the ANG put in an LOD for the injury since I had previously had shoulder surgery the C&P doc felt that despite the LOD it did not change the natural progression if the shoulder after surgery. \n\nBest of luck.",
    "Response_4": "Based on medical information (and your history and relationship with your commander, i.e. any miliitary discipline action or UCMJ), your commander will fill out DA 7652.  In an example case, let's say you are an E-6 11B and you are diagnosed with PTSD rated  at 70% (more than likely being a prolongued condition).  You would not be allowed to carry and fire a personally assigned weapon again in the military based on that.  A permanent profile should be issued with a 3 in your PULHES S Category, and your commander will take that into consideration.  Based on that alone, your commander should not recommend retaining you in your current duty position because you are not qualified to be an infantry squad leader anymore....especially because you MUST be able to carry and fire a weapon.\n\nI have seen other cases where someone was an admin specialist, and had the same thing, with a 3 in their PULHES S, and still be able to stay in the Guard.  There are certain waivers that can be done....but in that case, the soldier would not be able to stay in based on that job.\n\nand the dd 2808 is a report of medical history. when my unit went through PHA (Periodic Health Assessment), the part to be filled out by the SM was filled out prior to going to the PHA. The rest of the form is filled out by the doctor. Based on that form, a temporary profile can be issued. I'm pretty sure that if that happens, then you will be flagged and required to seek treatment on your own (which you have apparently already done). You are on the right track....it just takes forever....mine was a little over 2 years from start to finish....and sometimes I went for 3-4 months without hearing a single thing from anyone. INARNG has a medical discharge company where they place all SM's with permanent profiles, and you are pretty much a ghost to the whole state and do not count against anyone's numbers.",

    "Question": "New Kid on the Block\n\nWell gang, I am new here so thought I would introduce myself. I am 66 years old. Currently rated at 30% PTSD, 30% Heart Disease, 10% Tinnitis. I am going in for a PTSD increase C & P in two weeks. I am a retired Airline Captain. Retired early due to heart disease. Had a 5X bypass and couldn't get my medical back. Physically I am in great shape, even my heart muscle, it is the coronary arteries that are messed up. I was a Platoon Doc with the 173rd Airborne Brigade, Vietnam 1968-1969. I have three grown daughters, 5 grandkids. None live close to me and even if they did I can't stand having kids around, can't stand having daughters around, can't fucking stand having anyone around for the most part. I am a loner, I left my soul in Vietnam. I have no idea how I survived as an Airline Captain for a major airline but I did and so did all my passengers. I only relate to other combat vets, have no use for anyone else. Anyway, that is me. I am here to read and to learn from whoever is pecking away on the keyboard.\n\nI see a VA MD every few months to manage the drugs she tries to get me to take. I refuse to take anything other than an occasional Clonazepam in the evening to relax me. Winter sucks in Montrose, Colorado. Too fucking cold. I like being out working in my yard, ATVing and shit like that. I am hoping for a 100% P and T. I think ? I no longer have a career to worry about, I am retired. I attend a weekly counseling class through a Vet Center. My wife and one of my daughers are both Law Enforcement, they keep me out of jail but it's been close a few times.",
    "Response_1": "If you enjoy being miserable, then you are doing a great job of it.\n\nIf you actually want to feel better, then you will stop screwing around, and get the treatment that you obviously need. Not being honest with your treating folks is the first step, and actually cooperating with treatment is the 2nd.\n\nYou can get better control of your symptoms, and lead a MUCH more comfortable life, but that is NOT going to happen without your cooperation.\n\nIt's YOUR life, and you can choose to live it however you want to. Personally, I find keeping the symptoms to an absolute minimum makes for a MUCH easier, and a LOT happier life.",
    "Response_2": "We are much alike. I hope that you have or can find a hobby that interests you. I only have one interest left and am struggling to keep that. Everything that goes wrong with family, I hold myself accountable. The weight is becoming unbearable but as I was taught in the service, \"I am the baddest son of a .............etc.\" so I continue on.\nNot much of an extended family but those who dare to show up will see me heading to my bunker. They can consider me rude or whatever, don't matter much. The longer I am alive, the longer my wife and daughter will have my income to live on. Ever thought about buying a cheap motor home and taking off for a while?? That's where my mind is for now. Everyone here (wife and daughter) could benefit from it.",

    "Question": "Need advice PTSD\n\nI have not posted much on the boards here but have came here a lot for advice and thank you for that. \n\nLast year I was awarded 50% PTSD along with 10% Tinnitus, 10% lumbosacral strain with degenerative arthritis of the lumbar spine, and 0% for left ear hearing loss all SC. I was in therapy for just over a year with a physiologist through the Vet Center and it seemed my PTSD was getting worse, my PCP at the VA prescribed me Trazadone 100mg (take 1/2 pill each night) to help me sleep. This did not work so he upped it to a full pill, still didn't work. Due to various issues I missed a few of my therapy sessions and have nto been back since the summer. I know i need to get back into counseling and my symptoms seem to be getting worse. Before I was diagnosed with PTSD I kept my self so busy i had no time for anything much less thoughts of anything. I went to college full time, had a full time job and was in the CA ANG. A few years ago I finished my degrees (BS and MS) and thats when the PTSD started manifesting itself where I was able to notice it (my wife had been telling me for years that she believed I had something wrong and thought it was PTSD but i was in denial). On Nov 7th i retired from the CA ANG, symptoms began to get worse so I thought maybe if i loaded myself up with way to much again that it would suppress it. It did not! So now here I am trying to decide if i should go back to th original psychologist i was going to (if he can take me back) or going to the VA health clinics mental health. I am concerned that the psychologist i was going to really did care about my health but wasn't doing what needed to be done. He taught me breathing exercises to control my anger but other than that there really was nothing else therapeutic and he could not prescribe anything to help i would have to go to my PCP to get anything which caused other issues. I addition I have now taken on all the extra work at work (still work full time) and i am way overwhelmed and cant concentrate, I will sit at my desk and get nothing done, one minute I'm writing a job and next minute 2 hours have passed that i can't remember, with sweaty palms and heart racing. \n\nAny advice on which i should choose? I know i NEED to get back into therapy and soon my wife keeps asking me whats wrong and i cant put it into words for her so i just tell her ill be fine, I know i should not tell her that and that she is concerned.\n\nSorry if i rambled on in this I go from not saying anything to spilling my guts in 2 seconds and tend to loose track of my thought process.",
    "Response_1": "I don't really have any good advice to give you other than to tell you to do your best to stay on top of therapy. Your PTSD can and will get much worse if you don't do something to abate it. \n\nSpeaking from my own experience, when I'm feeling good I tend to drop out of treatment as I don't think it's necessary. When I feel really bad I tend to not want to have anything to do with treatment so I drop out then too. Unfortunately, dropping in and out of treatment isn't very abnormal. I would imagine your psychologist would be understanding if you went back to him/her.",
    "Response_2": "I won't presume to to tell you what to do, however I will relate to you what is working for me. I too made myself so busy that I thought I was dealing with my PTSD symptoms. I avoided and thought I was coping for forty-some years. I retired and my symptoms became much worse. I finally went in for treatment and am on some meds and twice weekly sessions. I'm no better, however I'm no worse either, and I'm learning to deal with it on day-to-today basis. Of significant help to me has been the support of my wife. She has gone through the bad old times with me not knowing what was the cause of the problems. Now we both know the initial cause(s), symptoms, and we are learning how to cope. I'll never be fully \"cured\", but I'm hoping that our remaining days on earth will be happier than those past days when I didn't \"have\" PTSD.",
    "Response_3": "Facing issues at work and dealing with PTSD can be extremely stressful at best. I was functioned mostly fine for nearly 5 years with a 70% rating. I was a chemist and I worked for the federal government. Then, out of nowhere on the 10-year anniversary or some of the more major fighting I was a part of I got into an argument with my wife. She threw my military service in my face as a derogatory thing and I ran to my basement, got a razorblade out of my toolbox and went to town cutting both of my wrists. I sprayed my blood all over her while yelling about the war like I was some sort of a crazy person (well, I guess I was). I had thought about suicide before, but I never really acted on it before. This came as a total surprise to me.\n\nI ended up spending a lot of time in the psych wards over the last 18 months. In fact I've spent about a total of 6 months in the psych ward during the time. I'm now rated at 100% and I'm collecting SSDI.\n\nThe timing for everything really worked out very well for me. I was awarded 100% while I was still working. 6 weeks later I left my job due to my disability. My wife was awarded the VA caregiver stipend (available to post 9-11 vets) and between the two payments, I was able to coast and pay all of my bills on the short term while I waited for SSDI and everything else to kick in for me. The only thing is I wasn't able to collect unemployment as I wasn't able to work (I was in a psychiatric hospital for the first month I was unemployed).\n\nI would not tell my boss or my coworkers about my PTSD issues. However, I would tell your HR department and provide them with documentation. I've found that coworkers and bosses get nervous around people with psychiatric issues. In my case, I believe their fear of working with a crazy person who has killed people had a lot to do with me being offered disability retirement from my job.",

    "Question": "PTSD claim might be denied due to conflicting people. Can anyone give me advice.\n\nI recently submitted a claim for PTSD. I was an infantryman who served in Iraq from 2004-2005 and earned my CIB. My claim is in the pending decision approval phase, but I think it might be not good. I think this becasue when I first spoke with VA (ptsd team) nurse she put me at PCL 55. Then I went to a VA PTSD intake exam (horrible experience with interviewer) and he put me at Axis V 80. Then I went to a Vet Center counselor and she put me at PCL 65. Finally I went to the C&P PTSD exam this month 12/2015 and I still dont know what he has put. I think the one bad VA interviewer experince will hurt my PTSD claim, I know I can reopen or disagree and re-start the process if bad decsion, but I am so done with all the process period. I've struggled with PTSD for over 10 years now, but I dont know if I can keep fighting for benefits. Any advice or motivation would help. Thanks in advance.",
    "Response_1": "First of all---- relax. Let the claim go where it will. Your anxiety will not change the outcome. The rater will take into account everything and all information. Your family history, your C file, etc..... - not just these brief impressions that you are concerned about. Your CIB will have influence here also. \nWhen given a positive and a negative report on a veteran, they should show preference to the positive report.\nIf you didn't file thru a VSO, then you should in the future, if you have any disagreements with the outcome. Please update the site here with the decision, when you receive it. \nThank you for your service",
    "Response_2": "You'll probably get service connected. You might not get the rating you want or deserve, but you'll at least be service connected. Results from various tests and exams are just part of the picture they look at. During my C&P the examiner checked the box that best indicated I would receive a rating of 70% in my ability to perform work. When I got the rating, they awarded me 100% P&T.

    "Response_1": "I have never heard of anyone having negative consequences from asking to change PCP's.\n\nBUT, have you tried talking with your current person about your concerns? You MIGHT be surprised by their response.",

    "Question": "Family members send texts msgs that trigger\n\nI have a immediate family member who constantly sends text msg's to me that trigger my PTSD so bad. I finally last night blocked their phone from being able to send anything to my phone..and I know it's right before Christmas and all but they don't understand what it does to me and I have asked them to go to the va clinic and go to counseling with me so they understand but they have not gone. My mental health is very fragile and I am extremely depressed and so I am.doing all I can to make it through this winter and now I have to be the bad guy by blocking my family member from calling or texting my phone...",
    "Response_1": "You are NOT being \"the bad guy\". You are doing what you have to do, because a family member is not listening to reason and keeps sending you messages that cause harm to you.\n\nIf your family does not understand this, then they REALLY need some education about PTSD.",
    "Response_2": "One of the hardest things to do is to shut down a family member but if they continually push your buttons then push the \"end\" button.  I have two sisters who I shut down because they were out of control and did not respect boundaries.  I think you made the right move.  Good luck going forward!",
    "Response_3": "Stay strong, man! You did the right thing. This is one of the hardest times of year for me and many of the vets in my PTSD group.  I'll be surrounded by in-laws (wife's side of family)...none of whom I have a damn thing in common with.  I stay spring loaded trying to endure their presence and their irritating comments.",
    "Response_4": "I thought I was the only one going through this. I have a brother who was leaving hurtful text on my phone also. The things he said you would have\nsworn we were not related. I literally had to skip out on one of my bills to go get a newer updated phone that would allow me the feature to block people.\nI realized at that moment when it worked that was the most important feature on the phone. It can save you from unexpected forces bringing your day \nall the way down when your already down.",
    "Response_5": "You are not alone. There are a LOT of people that do the same thing. I have an iPhone and it has the ability to block as many numbers as you want. I had to block several people. Then someone thought it would be funny to spoof their number. It is a way to make the number they are calling from show up on your phone as a different number.\nI had to go into my settings and fix it to where I only get calls from my contacts.\nPeople can be hateful and mean. You have to keep your sanity. You did the right thing."

    "Question": "Going to see my therapist and need to.\n\nRated 100% PTSD and not doing well at all.  Self abuse, etc.  Service dog is in my lap to say I've got your back.  Cuddles me when he knows I'm not well.  Taking him with me today.  Feel like I'm heading over the deep end again.",
    "Response_1": "Relax and mellow down easy, Mule....you may be just now realizing your 100% and feeling a bit broken.  We all go through this sort of thing whether we discuss it or not.\n\nTell your therapist....be honest, with her and with yourself....do a little introspection....you'll get through the shock of it all (and you worked awfully hard to get here.)",
    "Response_2": "For me, I have a hard time vocalizing the way that I feel in therapy. I find it helpful and therapeutic to put my thoughts down on paper - either in a list or bullet form or in a full blown paragraph.\n\nThe self abuse thing is something I go through as well. I get a bad case of the \"f-ck its!\" as I call them and I stop caring about anything. I take 5-10x my prescribed dosage of medications, take 1/2 a box to a full box of sleeping pills, then drink a couple of beers with it all and knock myself out. I'm not looking to kill myself, but I honestly don't care if I never wake up when I'm in those states. The only thing I hate is that afterwards I feel groggy and beat down for 2-3 days after doing this.",

    "Question": "Results for my PTSD exam\n\nI received the results for my PTSD exam with the box checked fot total occupational and social impairment. I am grateful on one hand and bummed on the other. There is nothing like being told that you are more fucked up than a football bat to give you something to chew on for the rest of the day. I am still not sure that I am willing to accecpt the diagnosis, because I personally do not think that I have done anything to rate that diagnosis. I refuse to take antidepressents any suggestions on therapy treatment? I am currently seeing a VA therapist monthly.",
    "Response_1": "Do you have a degree in Medicine? Do you have some special expertise in diagnosing and treating people with mental disabilities?\n\nI am asking, because it appears that YOU are CHOOSING to substitute your beliefs for a diagnosis made by a professional in the mental health field.\n\nThe ONLY person that you are hurting with that attitude is yourself. Your refusal to accept the appropriate treatment, including medications if indicated, will also damage your relationships with others.\n\nYou do NOT do anything to \"rate that diagnosis\". Instead, things were done unto YOU, things that caused you to develop PTSD. You experienced things that have caused you to develop this, and your \"feeling\" that you don't deserve treatment, etc. is a VERY common one.\n\nPTSD does not mean you are \"weak\", does not indicate that you are \"weak minded\", or anything except that you experienced an event, or a series of events, that has caused this disorder to occur.\n\nYOU DESERVE THE VERY BEST TREATMENT POSSIBLE, TO GET YOUR SYMPTOMS UNDER CONTROL. Refusing to accept NORMAL treatment causes you MORE harm, and results in your disorder getting worse.\n\nFor your own sake, and for the sake of family and friends, get the most treatment that you can, and stop refusing medications if they are recommended.",
    "Response_2": "I almost waited too long to get the help I needed....Self Diagnosis and PTSD does not compute...I tried, failed, then failed again, then again....the list goes on. Take it from one that knows first hand.\n\nI never, ever dreamed I could feel like I do today...Perfect, NOPE, a long way from it, but even further away from how I was 5 yrs ago.\n\nThere's been some very good advice given...don't look the other way.\n\nGood Luck Brother",
    "Response_3": "I completely get what you are saying.\n\nI was awarded 100% P&T from the VA and SSDI and I've been \"disabled\" since May of this last year and I'm trying to come to terms with it myself.\n\nIn our society, a lot of a man's identity comes from his occupation. It's one of those question people ask in a casual conversation that does a lot to size-up the other person. It also provides a lot of identity for your family. I used to work as a chemist for the federal government. I was one of 2 people that tested all of the gold and silver our government owns and produces bullion coins out of. From 2010-2014, I personally tested 10% of all gold bullion produced in the world. I know my wife got a lot of esteem out of her husband being a chemist. Now that I'm considered a disabled vet, what do my kids tell their friends at school when they are asked \"what does your dad do?\"\n\nI don't have any answers for you. I've been struggling with this problem myself since May.\n\nI will tell you that I am dabbling with trying to get back into work. I would love get back into another scientific job like the one I had. For me, working towards a goal of some sort starts to help even if it may or may not be a realistic expectation that it will come to fruition.",

    "Question": "Question to those who have filed/been awarded PTSD (Service Connected)\n\nHey Everyone....\n\nI've lurked these forums for years and have gained substantial information since my initial disability claim in 2009. I am currently sitting at 50% with an open appeal for PTSD (Combat related) from my time in OIF in 2005-2006. \n\nI originally claimed PTSD in 2009 with my original claims and it was denied as it was stated that it was not found to be service connected. At the time, I didn't understand or took the time to review the appeals process so I left it alone until 2013 when I began having increased bouts with sleepenessnes, depression, and various other issues. I opened the claim back up and again, it was denied due to it not being service connected in 2014. \n\nApparently it was continually denied due to it not having a NEXUS connection or a formal diagnosis from the VA. I enlisted the assistance of the DAV to help me with a re-file and in the past year, I have been seeing mental health at the Seattle VA once every few months. I have been formally acknowledged to have PTSD from the doctor there and put on a few different medications (Ambien for sleep issues, Prazosin for PTSD related stress/anxiety). I've been taking both of those for about 6-8 months or so now and have seen an improvement in both my sleep and overall anxiety throughout my days. \n\nI was awarded a CAB in 2006 so I have that distinction tying my direct combat related activites. I had my C & P exam with QTC in Tacoma, WA last Friday and felt like that went well. \n\nMy question is, what else could I be possibly missing here? I will be the first to say while I believe I have PTSD and am on various meds to help treat it, I am far from some others who have debilitaing PTSD. Since leaving the service, I've been able to go to college and graduate with two degrees from good universities and I do have a pretty good federal job. So I am able to live a semi normal life but still clearly have the underlying issues which have been discussed at the VA and so after fighting for six years, I was just looking for some input here as to where I may stand and what else I could possible do.\n\nI feel like I've covered all my bases and really can't do much else at this point to get them to recgonize it as a service connected issue. \n\nThanks everyone!",
    "Response_1": "Instead of seeing a treating person \"once every few months\", you need to be in a higher level of treatment than that. PTSD SYMPTOMS are treatable, and it is a LOT better to keep them at a minimum, than it is to try to collect a higher check every month.\n\nMoney will NOT make you better, treatment can do that.\n\nIt's your life.",
    "Response_2": "First, I would like to clarify that you said that you were missing a nexus between your combat time and your current PTSD symptoms.  Assuming this is correct, I would ask if you have had the time to get with your VSO to see if the C&P exam results have posted.  That would be your next step.  A nexus is really only a connection between whatever your stressor was while in uniform, and a current disability (PTSD).  A doctor can opinion a nexus and I have seen these opinions frequently on C&P exams.  There is really nothing you can do until the C&P exam comes back, and then, based on those results will determine what, if any, your steps should be.  Sounds like you are nearing the end to the process, and adding more fuel to the fire at this point may make the process last longer, making you wait while new evidence is added to the pile.",
    "Response_3": "Is that not a qualifiable NEXUS? The fact that I take medications everyday to combat the issue? Or the fact that PTSD was found by the VA along with the statements provided to the VA along with the awarding of a CAB which speaks to being directly involved in a combatitive situation?\"\n\nNot necessarily. Post Traumatic Stress Disorder is not exclusively a military or combat related disorder - anyone exposed to a traumatic event ( car wreck, for example)can have PTSD. \n\nThe amount or type of treatment that you receive may speak to the current state of your illness but does not service connect it. We often see vets post on this board about being denied service connection for a condition and they then go gather more medical evidence about the degree of disability they may have - which still does not address the service connection issue.\n\nGenerally , you need \n� credible evidence that the claimed in-service stressor occurred (unless PTSD was diagnosed in service) \n� medical evidence diagnosing PTSD and \n� a link, established by medical evidence, between current symptoms and the in-service stressor\n\nThe treating physician putting in his notes what you told him about the stressor is not necessarily credible evidence of the stressor. However, The lay testimony of a combat Veteran alone (your CAB) may establish an in-service stressor for the purposes of establishing service connection for PTSD, IF the claimed stressor is related to that episode of combat, there is no clear and convincing evidence to the contrary, and the claimed stressor is consistent with the circumstances of your service. \n\nHave you submitted a statement in support of the claim identifying your stressor? I would not rely on the medical notes or C&P results to get me there - they may but why not address the issue directly. \n\nYou have had two denials of service connection on this issue - both denials would have explained why the claim was denied. Those reasons need to be addressed.",
